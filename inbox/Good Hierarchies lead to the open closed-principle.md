"Use of inheritance results in cod that can be described as _open-closed_; hierarchies are open for extension while remaining closed for modification. Adding a new subclass to an existing hierarchy requires no changes to existing code. Hierarchies are thus _usable_; you can easily create new subclasses to accommodate new variants."
