#SoftwareDesign 

- Transparent: The consequences of change should be obvious in the code that is changing and in distant code that relies upon it.
- Reasonable: The cost of any change should be proportional to the benefits the change achieves.
- Usable: Existing code should be usable in new and unexpected contexts.
- Exemplary: The code itself should encourage those who change it to perpetuate these qualities.
