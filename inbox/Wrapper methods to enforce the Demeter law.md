"One common way to remove train wrecks from code is to use delegation to avoid dots. In object-oriented terms, to _delegate_ a message is to pass it on to another object, often via a wrapper method. The wrapper method encapsulates, or hides, knowledge that would otherwise be embodied in the message chain."
