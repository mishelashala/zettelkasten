#SoftwareDesign 

"Do these refactorings even when you do not know the ultimate design. They are needed, not because the design is clear, but because it isn't. You do not have to know where you're going to use good design practices to get there. Good practices reveal good design."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p31
