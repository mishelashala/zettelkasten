#coupling 

"Message chaining creates a dependency between the original object and every object and message along the way to its ultimate target. These additional couplings greatly increase the chance that the first object will be forced to change because a change to _any_ of the intermediate objects might affect it."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p40
