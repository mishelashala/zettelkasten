"If your target is moving, or if you don't know all the factors, you use tracer bullets--little phosphorous rounds intermixed with real rounds in your gun. As you fire, you can actually see the traer bullets. And where they are landing is where the actual bullets are landing. I you're not quite on target--because you can see if you're not on target--you can adjust your position."
