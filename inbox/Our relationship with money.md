#consumerism 
"We project onto money the capacity to fulfill our fantasies, allay our fears, soothe our pain, and send us soaring to new heights. In fact, we now meet most of our needs, wants, and desires through money. We buy everything from hope to happiness. We no longer live life. We consume it."

Mr Money Moustache, Your money or your life, p18.
