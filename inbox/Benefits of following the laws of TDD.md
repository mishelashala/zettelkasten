#TDD 

"If you follow the three laws that seem to silly, you will:
	Reduce your debug time dramatically.
	Significantly increase the flexibility of your system, allowing you to keep it clean.
	Create a suite of documents that fully describe the low level behavior of the system.
	Create a system design that has extremely low coupling."
