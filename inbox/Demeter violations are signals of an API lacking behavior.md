"The train wrecks of Demeter violations are clues that there are objects whose public interfaces are lacking. Listening to Demeter means paying attention to your point of view. If you shift to a message-based perspective, the messages you find will become public interfaces in the objects they lead you to discover."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p83
