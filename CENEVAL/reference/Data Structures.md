## Problem Solving

### Formalize a problem before attempting to solve it

«once a problem is formalized, we can look for solutions in terms of a precise model and determine whether a program already exists to solve that problem.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Stepwise Refinement

«To convert such an informal algorithm to a program, however, we must go through several stages of formalization (called _stepwise refinement_) until we arrive at a program the meaning of whose steps are formally defined by a language manual.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

## Algorithms

### Definition of Algorithm

«a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Algorithms can be executed any number of times

«In an algorithm instructions can be executed any number of times, provided the instructions themselves indicate repetition.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Algorithms must be finite

«no matter what the input values may be, an algorithm terminate after executing a finite number of instructions.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Heuristic Algorithm

«An algorithm that quickly produces good but not necessarily optimal solutions is called a _heuristic_»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

## Graphs

### Definition of Graph

«A _graph_ consists of a set of points called _vertices_, and lines connecting the points, called _edges_.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Coloring of a Graph

«A _coloring_ of a graph is an assignment of a color to each vertex of the graph so that not two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Coloring and NP-Complete problems

«coloring an arbitrary graph with as few colors as possible is one of a large class of problems called "NP-complete problems," for which all known solutions are essentially of the type "try all possibilities."»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Greedy Coloring Algorithm

«One reasonable heuristic for graph coloring is the following "greedy" algorithm. Initially we try to color as many vertices as possible with the first color, then as many as possible of the uncolored vertices with the second color, and so on.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

(See [[#Heuristic Algorithm]] for reference)

### k-clique definition

«In graph theory, a _k-clique_ is a set of _k_ vertices, every pair of which is connected by an edge.»

Alfred Aho, Data Structures and Algorithms

### k-color definition

«Obviously, _k_ colors are needed to color a _k_-clique, since no two vertices in a clique may be given the same color.»
