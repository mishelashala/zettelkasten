## Architectures should be open ended

"Architecture must define an appropriately open system considering its continued evolution beyond the first release. If it is closed, every change becomes progressively more expensive. At some point the cost per feature added becomes too expensive, and people start to talk about rewriting or replacing the software."

Christ Sterling, Managing Software Debt, pxxii

## Architectures should be adaptable

"Elements of the software architecture are built and proven early to support the business priorities, and other parts are delayed until they rise in priority. In this way, software architecture is reviewed, updated, and improved in an evolutionary way."
