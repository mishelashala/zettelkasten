"I believe you should always design the logical structure of you database without regard to any RDBMS. By doing so, you're more likely to design a sound structure because you'll be focused on the organization's information requirements. After your design is complete, you can then clearly determine how you should implement the database (single-user application, client/server, web-based, and so on) and which RDBMS you should use to facilitate the implementation."
