## Benefits of narrow and shallow hierarchies

"The hierarchy's small size makes it understandable, intention revealing, and easily extendable. Because these objects meet the criteria for successful use of inheritance, the risk of being wrong is low, but in the unlikely event that you _are_ wrong, the cost of changing your mind is also low."
