## Agile's Contribution

"Perhaps Agile's biggest contribution is the recognition of the humannes of systems development. Agile organizations connect software and the business, and Agile processes provide communication patterns connecting the system-building teams, and the teams with the business, as well as role definitions."

## Agile Supports Evolutionary Design

"Rather than supporting the design of significant portions of the software architecture before the software is built, Agile methods identify and support practices, processes, and tools to enable evolutionary design."

## Agile Prevents BDUF

"Teams should have 'just enough' initial design to get started."

## Why agile works

"Agile works because it acknowledges that certainty is unattainable _in advance_ of the application's existence; Agile's acceptance of this truth allows it to provide strategies to overcome the handicap of developing software while knowing neither the target nor the timeline."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p8
