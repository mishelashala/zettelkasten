## Summary of Agile

"We don't know what we're doing" and "We don't know when we'll be done" can be a difficult sell.

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p8

## Agile's Contribution

"Perhaps Agile's biggest contribution is the recognition of the humanness of systems development. Agile organizations connect software and the business, and Agile processes provide communication patterns connecting the system-building teams, and the teams with the business, as well as role definitions."

Chris Sterling, Managing Software Debt, pxviii

## Agile Requires Design

"Agile thus does not prohibit design, it requires it. Not only does it require design, it requires really good design."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p9

## Agile Prevents BDUF

"Teams should have 'just enough' initial design to get started."

Chris Sterling, Managing Software Debt ,xxi

## BUFD is a control illusion

"The desire for BUFD persists because, for some, it provides a feeling of control that would otherwise be lacking. Comforting though this feeling may be, it is a temporary illusion that will not survive the act of writing the application."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p8

## Agile rings two things true

"If Agile is correct, two other things are also true. First, there is absolutely no point in doing a Big Design Up Front (BUFD) (because it cannot possibly be correct), and second, no one can predict when the application will be done (because you don't know in advance what it will eventually do)."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p8

## Agile processes guarantee change

"Agile processes _guarantee change_, and your ability to make these changes depends on your application's design. If you cannot write well-designed code, you'll have to rewrite your application during every iteration."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object-Oriented Design, p9

## Agile Supports Evolutionary Design

"Rather than supporting the design of significant portions of the software architecture before the software is built, Agile methods identify and support practices, processes, and tools to enable evolutionary design."

Christ Sterling, Managing Software Debt, pxxii

## Why agile works

"Agile works because it acknowledges that certainty is unattainable _in advance_ of the application's existence; Agile's acceptance of this truth allows it to provide strategies to overcome the handicap of developing software while knowing neither the target nor the timeline."
