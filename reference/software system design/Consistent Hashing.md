#Hashing

"Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is re-sized and consistent hashing is used, only k/n keys need to be remapped on average, where k is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots. In contrats, in most traditional hash tables, a chagne in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped."
