## What TDD is about

"TDD is about creating a supportable structure for imminent change."

Chris Sterling, Managing Software Debt, p68

## TDD Laws

"You must write a failing unit test before you write production code.
You must stop writing that unit test as soon as it fails; and not compiling is failing.
You must stop writing production code as soon as the currently failing test passes."

## Benefits of following the laws of TDD

"If you follow the three laws that seem to silly, you will:
	Reduce your debug time dramatically.
	Significantly increase the flexibility of your system, allowing you to keep it clean.
	Create a suite of documents that fully describe the low level behavior of the system.
	Create a system design that has extremely low coupling."

## Quality as an afterthought

"Executing the tests after the code has been written makes quality an after thought."
