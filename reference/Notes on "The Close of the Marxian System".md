## 1. Chapter One: The Theory of Value and Surplus Value

### The Marxian definition of commodities

Böhm-Bawerk states that Marx limits the definition of commodities in order to distinguish them from other economic goods, he tells us that «[Marx] limits from the beginning to _commodities_, by which, according to him, we are not to understand all economic goods, but only those _products of labor_ which are made for the market.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p9, _Emphasis is ours_).

In other words, the difference between a commodity and any other economic good (land, natural resources, etc) is that commodities contain human labor within them, and the rest of economics god don't. This point will be central to Böhm-Bawerk's critic.

### The duality of a commodity

Böhm-Bawerk expands on the duality of a commodity. First he tells us that «A commodity is, on one side, a useful thing, which by its properties satisfies human wants of some kind and», he continues, «on the other, it forms the material medium of exchange value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p9).

The first property (being a useful thing) is called a "use value". The second property (being a material medium of exchange value) is called an "exchange value".

### What Determines the value of commodities

Böhm-Bawerk explains us that the core idea behind Marx's labor value of theory is as follows: «the whole value of commodities was based on the labor embodied in them» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p4).

### Definition of exchange value

For a better understanding of the concept of exchange value Böhm-Bawerk quotes Marx directly: «Exchange value presents itself in the first instance as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which values in use of one kind are exchange for values in use of another kind» (Marx, 1887).

In other words, If a were to exchange a use value **A** for a use value of **B**, the exchange value would be how much of B I would get for A, or viceversa.

Marx continues by explaining that «a relation which constantly changes with time and place.» (Marx, 1887). In other words, just because today in Italy _use value_ **A** is exchange for _x_ of _use value_ **B** doesn't mean that tomorrow that exchange rate will be the same. And that just because in Italy the exchange rate is _x_ doesn't mean that in Spain the exchange rate has to be the same.

### The accidental nature of exchange values

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that due to the constantly changing nature of exchange values due to time and place «Exchange value, therefore, appears to be something accidental.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p10).

How can commodities have always changing relation exchanges? He then tells us: «And yet there must be in this changing relation something that is stable and unchanging.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p10).

### A common factor for all commodities

He relies on Marx to explain this stable and unchanging something present in all commodities: «[...] there exists a common factor of the same magnitude in two different things, in a quarter of wheat and in cwt. of iron. The two things are therefore equal to a third which is in itself neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, so far as it is an exchange value, must therefore be reducible to that third.» (Marx, 1887).

In this passage Marx goes into deducing by law of transitivity there must be a common factor for all exchange relations. If commodity _A_ can be exchanged by _B_, and _B_ can be exchanged by _C_, then commodity _A_ can be exchanged by commodity _C_.

### The nature of the common factor

The quote from Marx continues with «This common factor cannot be a geometrical, physical, chemical or other natural property of the commodities.» (Marx, 1887).

At this point Marx, nor Böhm-Bawerk have not explained (yet) why this property has to be non-physical. So this stays as a open question to be answered.

One thing to note here is that this point of contingency will also be relevant when Böhm-Bawerk discusses Werner Sombert's apology in the last chapter.

All we can say for now is that the implication from that passage is that the common factor, therefore, has to be metaphysical.

### The role of physical properties in commodities

Once established the idea that the common factor has to be metaphysical, then what can be said about physical properties?

Marx tells us that «[the] physical properties [of commodities] come into consideration for the most part only in so far as they make the commodities useful, and so make them values in use.» (Marx, 1887, _clarification is ours_).

In other words, the physical properties of commodities is what makes them useful. It is the ability of an iron cast pan to get hot what gives it its ability to be used for cooking. With different physical properties, or none of the necessary physical properties for cooking, whatever thing we had in hand would not be of use.

Take a sheet of paper as an example. It doesn't have the shape, the material, nor the burning point of an iron cast pan. The physical properties of such sheet of paper make it useless for cooking.

### Values of use "don't" determine exchange relations

Marx continues by stating that «the exchange relation of commodities is obviously determined without reference to their values in use.» (Marx, 1887).

In other words, when determining the exchange relations of commodity _A_ in correspondence with commodity _B_ we don't care about the physical properties of the commodities.

> Note: this point seems counter intuitive

### Values in use and exchange values are mutually exclusive

For Marx value in use and values are mutually exclusive. He leaves that clear when he states that «As values in use commodities are above everything of different quality; as exchange values they can only be of different quantity, and they can, therefore, contain no atom of value in use.» (Marx, 1887)

In other words, when we exchange something is because we render that commodity completely useless. When we exchange a cast iron pan for a set of cooking knifes we are implying that not a single atom in that cast iron pan is of use for us.

With this Marx re-iterates his previous point that this common factor between commodities is not physical, but metaphysical.

### "Reaching" a common factor by elimination

Marx continues by saying that «If we then abstract from the value in use of commodities, there remains to them only one common property, that of being products of labor.» (Marx, 1887).

This is where, according to Böhm-Bawerk, the first critical fallacy of the Marxian system appears.

If we remember, at the beginning Böhm-Bawerk references the definition of _commodity_ that Marx gave. And leaves clear that Marx defines a commodity as only the exchange goods that are product of human labor, leaving out natural resources and non-labor based exchange goods.

Now, that Marx is looking for a common factor for exchange rates he "reaches" the conclusion that has to be "being products of human labor".

This is one of the principal criticisms that Böhm-Bawerk makes to the Marxian system: that its definition of commodity and exchange rates rely on circular logic: all commodities are the product of human labor, human labor is the common factor in all commodities.

### The process of elimination

Let's continue with the process by which Marx reached out this conclusion. Marx tells us that «if we abstract from the value in use of a commodity, we at the same time abstract from the material constituents and forms which give it a value in use. It is no longer a table, or a house, or yarn, or any other useful thing. All its physical qualities have disappeared.» (Marx, 1887).

This statement is supported by two previous ideas. Fist, that _values_ and _use values_ are mutually exclusive. And, second, that when we determine exchange relations we only care about the _value_ and not the _value in use_.

Without those two pre-requisites this process of elimination is rendered useless. But, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that both premises are true.

### All physical properties are gone

Marx continues by stating that the commodities are «[no] longer the product of the labor or the carpenter, or the mason, or the spinner, or of any other particular productive industry. With the useful character of the labor products here disappears the useful character of the labors embodied in them, and there vanish also the different concrete forms of these labors.» (Marx, 1887, _clarification is ours_).

This passage hints a future dichotomy in Marxian thinking: concrete human labor vs abstract human labor. By process of elimination the concrete human labors becomes abstract human labor.

Marx concludes by saying that «[commodities] are no longer distinguished from each other, but are all reduced to identical human labor—abstract human labor.» (Marx, 1887, _clarification is ours_).

### A clear definition of value

Böhm-Bawerk considers abstract human labor the true definition of value within the Marxian system. He tells us «With this then we have the conception of value discovered and determined.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11).

On so far we have reached a definition of value, this seems odd, due to the fact that Böhm-Bawerk jumped from Marx's discussion about determining the _common factor_ in _exchange_ relations, to a process of elimination to determine it, to a definition of _value_. But _value_ was not the thing that was being discussed.

### Value is not the same as exchange value

To this, Böhm-Bawerk tells us that _value_ «is in dialectical form not identical with exchange value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11).

He then elaborates further by saying _value_ «is a kind of logical distillation from» _exchange relation_ (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11).

Nor Marx, nor Böhm-Bawerk explanation seem to be clear enough. What is the relation between _value_ and _exchange value_ in this context?

### Exchange value is a form of value

Böhm-Bawerk tries to clarify by quoting Marx: «the exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed» (Marx, 1887, p45).

With this we have a better understanding of the relation between _value_ and _exchange value_. For the Marxian system _value_ is a metaphysical entity that can only be expressed physically y _exchange value_.

### Commensurability of exchange value

Since value a metaphysical property it cannot be measured in any way. But _exchange value_ by being a physical expression of _value_ can.

### How do we measure exchange value

Böhm-Bawerk tell us that «As labor is the substance of value so the amount of the value of all goods is measured by the quantity of labor contained in them, which is, in its turn, measure by its duration» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11-12).

Again, we see the use of the law of transitivity. Since _exchange value_ can be measured by _human labor_, and _human labor_ can be measured in _time_, therefore we can measure _exchange value_ using _time_.

### Definition of Working time

But when both, Marx and Böhm-Bawerk, say that _time_ is the measure of _exchange value_ how are they measuring time?

Böhm-Bawerk, again, quotes Marx to clarify how _time_ is measured in commodities. Marx defines that _time_ as the «working time required to produce value in use under the normal conditions of production, and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society"» (Marx, 1887, p46).

Let's unpack this definition.

First, the phrase "working time required to produce value in use under the normal conditions of production". It seems obvious that the time it would take a worker to produce a commodity in _normal circumstances_ (he has all the necessary tools and resources, his tools are in a good state, etc) is different from someone that doesn't (he doesn't have all the tools and resources, his tools are broken, etc).

Second, the phrase "and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society". A worker using a "state of the art" method or machinery not available to every worker would require a different amount of working time than his peers or to other workers in a different country.

### Socially necessary working time

There's a point of contingency that every first-time reader of the Marxian system encounters when reading the definition of _exchange value_, that is: any worker could artificially increase the "value" of his commodity by increasing the amount of time it takes to create it by finding ways to take "longer".

Marx shields his definition by stating that «it is only the quantity of socially necessary labor, or the working time socially necessary for the production of a value in use, which determines the amount of the value.» (Marx, 1887).

Meaning that all the "unnecessary" time in the production of a _commodity_ has no effect in the _exchange value_ of the commodity.

### Same working time as the common factor

Finally, Marx tells us that «Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labor are embodied, or which can be produced in the same working time, have the same value.», (Marx, 1887).

From this have finally come to the common factor in _exchange relations_: socially necessary working time. Two commodities have the same _exchange value_ when they have the same _socially necessary working time_ embodied in them.

### The law of value

This is what Böhm-Bawerk calls "Marx's law of value". According to Böhm-Bawerk, this law «states, and must state, after what has gone before, that commodities are exchanged in proportion to the socially necessary working time incorporated in them.», (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p12).

### The law of value and the law of supply and demand

Böhm-Bawerk let us know that within the Marxian system supply and demand are considered as constant oscillations of the prices, but these «constant oscillations of market prices [...] compensate and cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average prices as their inner law» (Marx, 1887, p184).

The concept of _cancelling each other_ is important both in the Marxian system and in Böhm-Bawerk's criticism of such system as we'll see later.

In the meantime we can say that by labelling supply and demand as "constant oscillations of market prices" Marx recognizes the existence of supply and demand. But saying that they "cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average prices" implies that supply and demand doesn't have an effect in market prices, and that the law of value prevails.

### The law of value imposes itself over time

As Böhm-Bawerk quotes directly from Marx: «the socially necessary working time always asserts itself by main force, like an overruling natural law, in the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations.» (Marx, 1887, p86).

### The "law of value" as a "natural and eternal law"

For Böhm-Bawerk, Marx is treating his "law of value" a kin to a natural, and eternal law. To make his case he quotes Marx saying «eternal law of exchange of commodities» (Marx, 1887, p215). Then he quotes Marx saying «the natural law of equilibrium», (Marx, 1894, p221).

## The surplus value doctrine

For Böhm-Bawerk the "law of value" is the first pillar in the Marxian system. From this "law of value" Marx deduces the second pillar his system: the doctrine of _surplus value_ (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

### What is the main teaching of this theory of surplus value

For Böhm-Bawerk the purpose of his doctrine of _surplus value_ is to know where _surplus value_ is coming from (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

### How capitalists operate

Böhm-Bawerk explains the capitalist cycle as follows: «Capitalists lay down a certain sum of money, convert it into commodities, and then—with or without an intermediate process of production—convert these back again into more money.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

### Profit doesn't come from buying commodities under their value

Böhm-Bawerk explains us that under the Marxian system profit doesn't come from the seller buying commodities at a price below market price: «He [Marx] first declares that the surplus value cannot originate either in the fact that the capitalist, as a buyer, buys commodities regularly under their value» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13, _clarification is ours_).

In other words, _profit_, in the Marxian system, doesn't come from the capitalist buying a commodity _A_ with an exchange value of _x_ at price _x - y_, and then selling that same commodity at _x_. In this scenario the _profit_ of the capitalist would be _y_.

### Profit doesn't come from selling commodities over their value

But since that is ruled out impossible within the Marxian system we could be tempted to think that it can come from selling the commodities _over their value_. But, Böhm-Bawerk leaves clear that, within the Marxian system, that is also impossible. He tells us that sources of _profit_ doesn't align with «the fact that the capitalist, as a seller, sells them over their value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

Therefore, it is impossible for a capitalist to buy a _commodity_ _A_ at value _x_ and then sell it at _x + y_, making the profit of the capitalist _y_.

### Theory of surplus value relies on the "law of value"

These two scenarios bring us the immediate question: but why? Within the Marxian system, the "law of value" is always reigning supreme, therefore _commodities_ **always** exchange _at their value_. The "law of value" rules out impossible those two scenarios: buying under value, and selling over value.

Marx tells us explicitly that «The owner of the money must buy the commodities at their value, then sell them at their value» (Marx, 1894, p185).

### If the "law of value" is false, then the doctrine of surplus value is false

Therefore, the doctrine of surplus value is completely dependent of the "law of value". If the "law of value" is false, then the doctrine of _surplus value_ is false. This is a point that Böhm-Bawerk doesn't explore in his work, but it is deducible from his explanation of the Marxian system and Marx's own words.

### The problem Marx is trying to solve

Marx continues by telling us that «and yet at the end of the process [the capitalist] must draw out more money than he put in. Such is the conditions of the problem» (Marx, 1894, p185).

This problem, again, is: where does profit originates?

### The problem is the result of the "law of value"

Marx operates under the premise that the "law of value" is true, therefore, he looks perplexed at this "magic trick" that originates: money coming out nowhere.

But if we remove the law of value, in other words, if we declare the law of value as false, then problem disappears. Without the "law of value" then the possibility of buying _commodities_ _under_ their value, and/or selling commodities _over_ their value can become an excellent explanation for the source of _profit_.

### The dishonest conflation of profit and surplus value

This is a good moment to make a parenthesis. In the same way that Marx purposely limits the range of a _commodity_ to get the result he wants, he conflates _profit_ and _surplus value_.

Within the Marxian system _surplus value_ and _profit_ are used interchangeably. But they are not the same. The term _surplus value_ is a loaded term. It implies that extra _value_ has been added to a _commodity_. And, as discussed earlier, _labor_ is what determines _value_ within the Marxian system.

By **always** using _surplus value_ when talking about _profit_ Marx is limiting the sources of _profit_ exclusively to _labor_, ruling out other possible sources. By doing so he gets the conclusion he already wanted, just as he did with the definition of _commodity_.

By ruling out the "law of value" as false, we then can discuss other sources of profit, rendering the whole doctrine of _surplus value_ as false.

### The theory of exploitation depends on the theory of surplus value

Just as the doctrine of _surplus value_ relies on the "law of value" and the _labor value theory_ being true, the doctrine of _exploitation_ relies on the doctrine of _surplus value_ being true.

If the "law of value" is false, or the theory of _labor value theory_ is false, then the doctrine of _surplus value_ is false. If the theory of _surplus value_ is false, then the theory of _exploitation_ is false.

### Labor power as the source of surplus value

But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let's get back to the problem of identifying the source of _surplus value_.

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that, in fact, Marx found a solution: labor power. He tells us that «there is one commodity whose value in use possesses that peculiar property of being a source of exchange value. This commodity is the capacity of labor, labor power.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13-14).

### Labor power as a commodity

He continues by saying that «[labor power] is offered for sale in the market under the twofold condition that the laborer is personally free, for otherwise it would not be his labor power only that would be for sale, but his whole person as a slave; and that the laborer is destitute of», here he's quoting Marx, «all the means necessary for the realizing of his labor power".» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14, _clarification is ours_).

In other words, laborers sell their _labor power_ as a _commodity_ in the market as free men under two conditions. The first one: they sell their whole body as slaves; the second one: they have to sell it because they don't own the means of production necessary to realize their labor as independent agents.

### Laborers send their labor power because they don't own means of production

Böhm-Bawerk makes emphasis in the second condition by stating «for otherwise [they] would prefer to produce on [their] own account and to offer for sale [their] products rather than [their] labor power» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14, _clarification is ours_).

This is a crucial point in the Marxian system: the idea that laborers are forced to sell their _labor force_ instead of selling their _commodities_ because they don't have any other option. In other words, they are trapped in their condition of laborers because of the material conditions. Change the material conditions by granting them control over the means of production and they gladly and without hesitation would sell their commodities one hundred percent of the time over selling their labor power.

### Surplus value comes from trading labor power

Böhm-Bawerk continues by saying that «it is by trading in this commodity that the capitalist obtains the _surplus value_.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

Here, we can see the circular logic in action again. By conflating the term _surplus value_ with _profit_ Marx glides us to the conclusion he wants.

If _profit_ cannot come from other sources but _surplus value_, and _surplus value_ is _labor added_ to a commodity, then he already had his conclusion prepared without having to search for it: _surplus value_ can only come from _labor power_.

### The regulation of labor power

_Labor power_ by virtue of being a commodity «is regulated like any other commodity by the working time necessary for its reproduction», (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

In this context the "working time necessary for its reproduction" would mean the minimum amount of food, shelter, and rest a worker would need in order to replenish his energies.

### The capitalist buys the labor power to make it work for him

Böhm-Bawerk then tells us that «If the capitalist has concluded this purchase, the value in use of the labor power belongs to him and he realizes it by causing the laborer to work for him.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

Meaning that once acquired the labor power through a financial transaction the capitalist can use that labor power as he wishes.

### Following the "law of value" would lead to no profit

«But if [the capitalist]», Böhm-Bawerk continues ,«made [the laborer] work only so many hours a day as are embodied in the labor power itself, and as must have been paid for in the buying of the same, no surplus value would arise» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

Here, Böhm-Bawerk, explains the concept of _appropriation of surplus value_ by the capitalist.

This premise relies both in the "law of value" being and the doctrine of _surplus value_ of being true. It relies on the "law of value" because all _commodities_ **must** exchange by their equal.

In the case of the "law of value": if a capitalist is buying eight hours of work, then the laborer must give the equivalent _value_ in commodities. And viceversa, if a laborer is selling eight hours work, then capitalist must receive the equivalent _value_ in _commodities_.

And in the case of the doctrine of _surplus value_: if the laborer adds three extra hours of labor to an commodity, then he must receive those three hours of work from the capitalist in exchange.

This two conditions would lead to an "equilibrium" in which each part is receiving exactly the same value, therefore, producing no surplus value for the capitalist nor the laborer. Equals exchanging for equals.

### The real source of profit: unpaid labor

«But this is not the way in which capitalists act», Böhm-Bawerk tells us. «Even if they have bought the labor power for a price which only corresponds to six hour's working time, they yet make the laborer work the whole day for them.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

This is where the _modus operandi_ of the capitalists is described. Under the interpretation of the Marxian system _profit_ comes from unpaid labor. The capitalist pays for certain amount of hours, but then make the laborer work for longer.

### Profit breaks the "law of value"

«And now in the product made during this day there are incorporated more hours of labor than the capitalist was obligated to pay for.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

This is where the "law of value" is broken for the Marxian system. Given that the "law of value" states that equals must be exchanged for equals, by receiving more from the laborer than what they are exchanging for they create a disequilibrium.

That disequilibrium can be expressed as follows: the laborer is producing _X_ value in commodities, but the capitalist is giving to the laborer _Y_. But _Y_ is not equal to _X_, but _X - Z_. Therefore they would not be exchanging _X_ for _Y_, in other words _X_ for _X_, but _X_ for _X - Z_. That _Z_ is the _surplus value_ added by the worker that is being not remunerated to him, in other words, it is being appropriated by the capitalist.

### Necessary Working Time

Böhm-Bawerk tell us that under the Marxian system the working time of the laborer is divided in two parts: «In the first part—the "necessary working time"—the worker produces the means necessary for his own support, or the value for those means» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16).

This part of the working time is the "minimum necessary" for the laborers to buy food, clothing, housing, and to replenish their energy to continue working.

Böhm-Bawerk continues telling us that «this part of his labor he receives an equivalent in wages.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16).

This may seems like an obvious thing that is not worth pointing out: the laborers do some labor, the capitalist pays them. But, this subtle phrase: "this part of his labor he receives an equivalent in wages" hints an implication in the Marxian system. The idea that the capitalist _only_ pays the laborers this part of their working time, just enough to continue replenishing they labor power, not less, not more.

### Surplus Working Time

This is made much more clear when Böhm-Bawerk tells us that «During the second part—the "surplus working time"—he is exploited, he produces "surplus value" without receiving any equivalent for it.», (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16).

### Surplus value is the result of unpaid working time

From this "unpaid" _surplus working time_ the capitalist gets his _surplus value_.

Böhm-Bawerk cites Marx himself in order to ratify this point: «All surplus value is in substance the embodimient of unpaid working time» (Marx, 1887).

### For Marx surplus value ONLY comes from "living work"

This conclusion has some implications, that Böhm-Bawerk will explore in detail. One of those implications is that _surplus value_ (_value_ added to a _commodity_) can only come from the work done from the laborer, and never from the means of production (machinery, tools, etc).

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that «new surplus value can only be created by the living work which the capitalist gets the worker to perform.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16).

This is in line with the Marxian system of thought, if we remember _human labor_ is the common factor among all _commodities_, and the _value_ of commodities has been established to come from _human labor_. Therefore, any added (_surplus_) _value_ can only come from new _labor_ embodied in _commodities_. And since _value_ is measured in _working time_, then it easy to conclude, within the Marxian system of thought, that all _surplus value_ is only the result of the _working time_ embodied in them by the laborer.

### For Marx surplus value NEVER comes from the means of production

And by following this line of thought we reach an obvious conclusion: if _surplus value_ can only come from _working time_ (human labor), then we can rule out any other mean as the source of _surplus value_.

This is precisely what Böhm-Bawerk tells us: «The value of the means of production which are used is maintained, and it reappears in a different from in the value of the product, but adds no surplus value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16).

This other form of "value" is what Marx would call "faux frais". Böhm-Bawerk never explicitly talks about it, and it is out of the scope of this essay, but the idea is clear: the means of production don't add _surplus value_ since it can only come from _human labor_ (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16).

Just to leave no room for interpretation, Böhm-Bawerk quotes Marx saying: «That part of the capital, therefore, which is converted into the means of production, that is, into raw material, auxiliary material, and implements of labor, does not alter the amount of its value in the process of production» (Marx, 1887).

### The rate of surplus value

From these two elements, the "necessary working time" and the "surplus working time" we can derive a rate, or proportion. Böhm-Bawerk says that «the proportion in which the surplus value stands to the advanced variable part of capital (in which alone the surplus value "makes good its value") Marx calls the _rate of surplus value_.»

We can express it arithmetically like this:

$$
Rate\ of\ Surplus\ Value = \frac{Necessary\ Working\ Time}{Surplus\ Working\ Time}
$$

### Rate of surplus value as a proxy for level of exploitation

The _rate of surplus value_ within the Marxian system is used as a proxy for degree of exploitation a laborer is experiencing. Böhm-Bawerk tells us that «[the rate of surplus value] is identical with the proportion in which the surplus working time stands to the necessary working time, or the unpaid labor to the paid, and serves Marx, therefore, as an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p16-17, _clarification is ours_).

The greater the _rate of surplus value_ the greater the degree of exploitation the laborer is under.

### The rate of surplus value is not the same as the rate of profit

One would be inclined to think that there's in an equivalence between the _rate of profit_ and the _rate of surplus value_. Böhm-Bawerk tells us that under the Marxian system, that is not the case, that the _rate of surplus value_ is «Totally different from this the rate of profit» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p17).

### How the rate of profit is calculated

How so? To that Böhm-Bawerk clarifies the matter by stating that «The capitalist calculates the surplus value, which he appropriates, not only upon the variable capital but upon the total amount of capital employed» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p17).

### How the amount of capital employed is calculated

The total _amount of capital employed_ is the sum of both _variable capital_ and _constant capital_, or using a different terminology _laborers' wages_ and the cost of _means of production_.


$$
Total\ Amount\ of\ Capital\ Employed = {Laborers'\ Wages} + {Cost\ of\ Means\ of\ Production}
$$

### The formula for the rate of profit

From the relationship between _variable capital_ and _constant capital_ Böhm-Bawer decudes that «the greater the variable and the less the constant capital employed [...] the higher will be the rate of profit.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p17).

According to the formula:

$$
Rate\ of\ Profit = \frac{Variable\ Capital}{Constant\ Capital}
$$

If we have in a _commodity_ **A** twice as much _variable capital_ than a commodity **B** but the same amount of _constant capital_, then the rate of _profit_ in _commodity_ **A** is twice as much as in _commodity_ **B**.

$$
Rate\ of\ Profit\ of\ commodity\ A = \frac{Variable\ Capital\ (100)}{Constant\ Capital\ (100)} = \frac{100}{100} = 1

## 2. Chapter Two: The Theory of The Average Rate of Profit and of the Price of Production

### Organic Composition of Capital

Böhm-Bawerk doesn't stop to define what is the "organic composition" of capital. But this is a good point to introduce the concept. Simply put, it is the amount of capital that is invested in each part of the production process, in other words how much is invested in _variable capital_ and how much in _constant capital_.

### Different organic composition of capital in different spheres

Böhm-Bawerk paraphrases Marx by telling us that «The "organic composition" [...] of the capital is for technical reasons necessarily different in the different "spheres of production"» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p19).

### Every branch of production has a special rate of profit

Then, Böhm-Bawerk introduces use to the concept of _special rate of profit_ by stating that «given an equal rate of surplus value, every branch of production must show a different, a special rate of profit, on the condition certainly, which Marx has hitherto always assumed, that commodities exchange with each other "according to their values," or in proportions to the work embodied in them.»

### Equal amount of capital, but different organic composition leads to different rates of profit
 
One important thing to notice, Böhm-Bawerk tells us, is that «[the Marxian] theory demands that capitals of equal amount, but of dissimilar organic composition should exhibit different profits.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p20).

### The real worlds shows the contrary

This is one of the central critiques Böhm-Bawerk has of the Marxian system: reality doesn't match with the description that Marx gives us. Böhm-Bawerk states that «The real world, however, most plainly shows that it is governed by the law that capitals of equal amount, without regard to possible differences of organic composition, yield equal profits.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p20).

Unfortunately, Böhm-Bawerk doesn't provide any evidence to back up such statement. But for the sake of argument, let's consider it to be true.

### The general tendency of capital

For Böhm-Bawerk this contradiction with reality puts the Marxian system in a predicament: if reality says otherwise, then the Marxian system is false.

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that Marx is aware of such contradiction of reality and quotes him from the third volume of the capital as follows: «there is a law (or general tendency), _although only for capitals possessing the same organic composition_—the same periods of turnover being assumed—that the profits are in proportion to the amounts of the capitals, and therefore equal amounts of capital yield in equal periods of time equal amounts of profit.» (Marx, 1894).

This is what in the Marxian system of thought is called the _general tendency of capital_.

### The general tendency of capital relies on the "law of value"

The citation continues with «The argument rests on the basis which has hitherto generally been the basis of our reasoning, _that commodities are sold according to their values_» (Marx, 1894).

That means that as long as the "law of value" holds true, then the _general tendency of capital_ will hold true.

### An different average rate of profit in different economic branches is impossible

Böhm-Bawerk continues with his quoting of Marx with: «the difference in the average rate of profit for different branches of industry _does not exist_ and could not exist without upsetting the whole system of capital production» (Marx, 1894).

At this point it is not clear, yet, in the exposition of Böhm-Bawerk of the Marxian system why that would be the case, but we'll ignore it in the meantime.

### Marx pointing the only way out of the contradiction

The citation from Marx by Böhm-Bawerk concludes with: «_It appears therefore that here the theory of values is irreconcilable with the actual movement of things_, irreconcilable with the actual phenomena of production, and that, on this account, the attempt to understand the latter must be given up.» (Marx, 1894).

From this Böhm-Bawerk, and us, can conclude that not only Marx was aware of the contradiction of his doctrine of _general tendency of capital_ and reality. But that also it was in contradiction with his law of value. And, to make matters worse, in order to cling into the doctrine of _general tendency of capital_ he had to accept that the _law of value_ did not hold true and did not imposes itself in the long ron as a "natural law".

That is precisely what Böhm-Bawerk tell us Marx does: «To speak plainly his solution is obtained at the cost of the assumption from which Marx has hitherto started, _that commodities exchange according to their values_. This assumption Marx now simply drops.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p21)

### Dropping the law of value makes the whole system tumble

Dropping the "law of value" is a hard blow to the marxian system. As we saw earlier a lot of doctrines (_surplus value_, _exploitation_, and _surplus working time_) rely on it. It jeopardises the whole Marxian system.

If the "law of value" is not true, then the capitalist can buy _commodities_ _under their price_ value, or sell them _over their price value_ allowing _profit_ to come from sources different than _unpaid working time_. Rendering the doctrine of _surplus value_ dead in the water.

And if the doctrine of _surplus value_ is false, and the capitalist is receiving profit from other sources then the capitalist is not _exploiting_ the laborer by means of appropriating _working time_ from the laborer.

### Solution proposed by Marx

Böhm-Bawerk copies a table directly from the capital in order to explain Marx's solution. Böhm-Bawerk explains us that «this tables shows, in the different spheres of production where the exploitation of labor has been the same, very different rates of profit, corresponding to the different organic composition of the capitals.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p21).

In order to have a better understanding of the table Böhm-Bawerk tells that «c denotes constant capital and v variable». (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p21).

Finally Böhm-Bawerk tells us that «constant capital–_the "used up c"_—goes into the value of the product, while the whole _"employed c"_ is taken into account in reckoning the rate of profit.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p21).

| Capitals       | Surplus Value | Used up C | Value of the commodities | Cost Price of the Commodities | Price of the commodities | Profit Rate, Percent | Deviation of the Price from the Value |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| I   80c + 20v  | 20            | 50        | 90                       | 70                            | 92                       | 22                   | +2
| II  70c + 30v  | 30            | 51        | 111                      | 81                            | 103                      | 22                   | -8
| III 60c + 40v  | 40            | 51        | 131                      | 91                            | 113                      | 22                   | -18
| IV  85c + 15v  | 15            | 40        | 70                       | 55                            | 77                       | 22                   | +7
| I 80c + 20v    | 5             | 10        | 20                       | 15                            | 37                       | 22                   | +17

From the table can see how different branches of production can have the same rate of surplus value, but different rates of profit.

This would indicate that the average rate of profit is false, but Böhm-Bawerk quotes Marx himself giving the solution to this phenomena.

First Marx says that «Taken together the commodities are sold 2 + 7 + 17 = 26 over their value, and 8 + 18 under their value» (Marx, 1894).

This at first glance hints us at what Böhm-Bawerk already has told us: Marx has abandoned the "law of value". In other words, it is not true that _commodities_ are always exchanged at their _values_. Or, in other words: _commodities_ can be sold _under_ and _over_ their _values_.

Marx continues by telling us that «[...] the variations in price mutually cancel each other, either through an equal division of the surplus value or by cutting down the average profit of 22 percent on the invested capital to the respective cost prices of the commodities, I to V; in the same proportion _in which one part of the commodities is sold over its value another part will be sold under its value. And now their sale at such prices makes it possible that the rate of profit for I to V should be equal_, 22 percent, without regard to the different organic composition of the capital I to V» (Marx, 1894).

Let's break down the method that Marx is describing us. We already have established that the rate of profit is a fixed 22%:

$$
\text{Average Profit Rate (fixed): }
R_p = 0.22 \quad \text{(22\%)}
$$

From the table we can deduce that the cost price of the _commodities_ is calculated as the _sum_ of the _variable capital_ and the _constant capital_:

$$
\text{Cost Price of Commodities: }
K = C + V
$$

From the table we can also deduce that the _value of the commodity_ is calculated as the sum of the _cost price of commodities_, and _surplus_:

$$
\text{Value of the Commodities: } V_C = K + S = C + V + S
$$

The _profit_ is defined as the _cost price of the commodities_ times the _rate of profit_:

$$
\text{Profit: }
P = K \times R_p
$$

Then the _redistributed_ _price of the commodities_ is the _cost price of the commodities_ plus the _profit_:

$$
\text{Price of Commodities (Redistributed): }
P_C = K + P
$$

And finally from there we can define the _deviation of the price from the value_ as the _price of the commodities_ minus the _value of the commodities_:

$$
\text{Deviation of the Price from the Value: }
D = P_C - V_C
$$

In order to verify that these formulas hold true we just need to derive all the values from the _variable capital_, _constant capital_, and _surplus value_:

| Capitals       | Calculated K (C + V) | Surplus Value (S) | Value of the Commodities (K + S) | Calculated (K + S) | Price of Commodities (K + P) | Calculated (K + P) | Calculated Profit | Calculated D (P_C - V_C) |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| I 80c + 20v    | 100                  | 20                | 90                               | 120                | 92                         | 92                     | 22                | +2                       |
| II 70c + 30v   | 100                  | 30                | 111                              | 130                | 103                        | 103                    | 22                | -8.                      |
| III 60c + 40v  | 100                  | 40                | 131                              | 140                | 113                        | 113                    | 22                | -18.                     |
| IV 85c + 15v   | 100                  | 15                | 70                               | 115                | 77                         | 77                     | 22                | +7                       |
| V 80c + 20v    | 100                  | 5                 | 20                               | 105                | 37                         | 37                     | 22                | +17                      |

From these calculations we can see that the math that Marx follows is sound.

### Different compositions of capital in fact lead to different rates of profit

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that at first glance it looks like different organic compositions of capital invested in different branches of productions in fact product very different rates of profit (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p23).

### How these results are nullified

But, Böhm-Bawerk tells us that even when that is the case Marx says that this phenomena is not important, an he quotes Marx on this, saying that because «these different rates of profit are reduced by competition to a common rate which is the average of all these different rates» (Marx, 1894).

At this point Böhm-Bawerk hasn't explained yet what Marx means with competition, but later down the road he will define it as the law of "supply and demand".

We can define the `average rate of profit` as follows:

$$
\text{Average Rate of Profit: }
R_p = \frac{\text{Total } S}{\text{Total } C + \text{Total } V}
$$

It is essentially the aggregate of the _surplus value_ divided by the aggregate of _constant capital_ plus the aggregate of _variable capital_.

### The concept of average profit

The quote from Marx continues with: «The profit corresponding to this common rate, which falls to a given amount of capital, whatever organic composition may be, is called _average profit_» (Marx, 1894).

Marx doesn't want us to consider how different organic compositions of capital produce different rates of profit individually, but as an average. And when considered as an average these "deviations" get "neutralized".

We can define the formula for the _average profit_ as follows:

$$
\text{Average Profit: }
P_{\text{avg}} = (C + V) \times R_p
$$

The _average profit_ is the sum of the _constant capital_ and _variable capital_ of an individual _commodity_ multiplied by the _average rate of profit_.

Or using the constant we had already defined earlier:

$$
\text{Average Profit: }
P_{\text{avg}} = K \times R_p
$$

The _cost price of a commodity_ times the _rate of profit_ of that commodity.

### The price of production of a commodity

The quote continues with: «The price of commodity which is equal to its cost price plus its share of the yearly average profit of the capital employed (not merely that consumed) in its production (regard being had to the quickness or slowness of turnover) is its _price of production_» (Marx, 1894).

We can then distill the formula for _price of production_ as follows:

$$
\text{Price of Production: }
P_{\text{prod}} = (C + V) + [(C + V) \times R_p]
$$

The _price of production_ of a _commodity_ is the sum of the _constant capital_ and _variable capital_, plus the same multiplied by the _rate of profit_.

Or, following the formulas defined above, the price of production is the _cost price of a commodity_ plus the _average rate of profit_:

$$
\text{Price of Production: }
P_{\text{prod}} = K + P_{\text{avg}}
$$

One thing to notice is that the _price of production_ and the _value_ of the commodities now are different. This point will be relevant in a moment.

### Calculating the values

Let's run through the formulas. First let's calculate the _average profit_:

$$
\text{Average Profit} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Number of Capitals}} = \frac{110}{5} = 22
$$

Now we let's calculate  the _average rate of profit_:

$$
R_p = \frac{\text{Total Surplus Value (S)}}{\text{Total Capital (C + V)}} = \frac{110}{500} = 0.22
$$

Finally we can calculate the _price of production_ for each individual _commodity_:

| Capitals       | Calculated K (C + V) | Surplus Value (S) | Average Profit (P_avg) | Price of Production (P_prod) |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| I 80c + 20v    | 100                  | 20                | 22                     | 122.0                        |
| II 70c + 30v   | 100                  | 30                | 22                     | 122.0                        |
| III 60c + 40v  | 100                  | 40                | 22                     | 122.0                        |
| IV 85c + 15v   | 100                  | 15                | 22                     | 122.0                        |
| V 80c + 20v    | 100                  | 5                 | 22.                    | 122.0                        |

With these results one may be tempted to think that the results are consistent. But there's a great error of method on Marx's part.

### The error of method in the calculation of prices of production

What Marx is trying to determine with these equations is how to calculate the **price of production** for each commodity. But there's a circularity in his equations.

First, the **total surplus value** depends on the prices of individual commodities, which in turn depend on their **prices of production**.

Second, to calculate the **prices of production**, we need the **average profit rate**, which itself requires the **total surplus value**.

This leaves us with a set of undetermined equations. In other words: without knowing the **prices of production**, we cannot determine the **total surplus value**. And, without the **total surplus value**, we cannot determine the **average profit rate**. And without the **average profit rate**, we cannot determine the **prices of production**.

This leads to a set of interdependent or **circular equations** where the unknowns (prices of production and average profit rate) cannot be resolved in isolation.

### Prices of production determine the exchange relations, not values

Marx finally tells us that «the actual exchange relation of the separate commodities is _no longer determined by their values but by their prices of production_» (Marx, 1894).

Here Marx is here is again abandoning his own "law of value". Once again, the "law of value" says that _commodities_ are always exchanged in relation to their equivalents in _values_. But here, he is doing a one eighty and is telling us that _commodities_ are exchanged by their _prices of production_ and not by their _values_, which, as we can see, are different.

### Values turn into prices of production according to Marx

Marx tells us that «the value changes into prices of production» (Marx, 1894).

This is relevant to the discussion because Marx seems to claim that both _values_ and _prices of production_ match. Which, leaving the matter of his equations being undetermined, don't.

The implication here is that we can use _price of production_ as _value_, meaning that the _price of production_ is the form that _value_ takes.

### The unrealistic conditions in which values turn into prices of production

Böhm-Bawek tells us that «Value and price of production are only exceptionally and accidentally coincident» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p24). Meaning that _value_ and _price of production_ will be the same only in exceptionally rare occasions, and by mere coincidence.

What are those conditions under which _value_ and _price of production_ will coincide? Böhm-Bawerk tells us that only on «those commodities which are product by the aid of capital, the organic composition of which chances to coincide exactly with the _average_ composition of the whole social capital.»

Let's look at a set of examples:

| Capitals      | Surplus Value (S) | Total Capital (C + V) | Value (C + V + S) | Price of Production (P_prod) |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| I 50c + 50v   | 20                | 100                   | 120               | 120                          |
| II 60c + 40v  | 20                | 100                   | 120               | 120                          |
| III 70c + 30v | 20                | 100                   | 120               | 120                          |
| IV  80c + 20v | 20                | 100                   | 120               | 120                          |
| V   90c + 10v | 20                | 100                   | 120               | 120                          |

In all these cases, the **organic composition** of the capitals match the **average composition**, ensuring that the **value** and **price of production** align. Only on those rare and accidental conditions Marx's equations would lead to a coincidence between _prices of production_ and _value_.

### Capitals of Higher Composition

Böhm-Bawerk tell us that Marx is aware of such circumstances, so he comes up with names for each scenario.

He quotes Marx saying that «capitals which contain greater percentage of constant, and therefore a smaller percentage of variable capital than the social average capitals», are named,  «capitals of _higher_ composition» (Marx, 1894).

### Capitals of Lower Composition

The quote from Marx continues exemplifying that «those capitals in which the constant capital fills a relatively smaller, and the variable a relatively larger space than in the social average capital are called capitals of _lower_ composition» (Marx, 1894).

### Higher composition allows selling commodities over their value

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that Marx accepts as a fact that «in all those commodities which have been created by the aid of capital of "higher" composition than the average composition the price of production will be _above_ their value» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p24).

### Lower composition allows selling commodities under their value

And by extension, «the opposite case will be [sold] _under_ the value» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p24, _clarification is ours_).

### Capitals of Lower and Higher composition violate the law of value

These two kinds of capital, once again, force Marx to abandon the "law of value". If a _commodity_ with a _higher composition_ of capital can be sold _over_ its _value_, then the "law of value" doesn't hold true. And _vice versa_, if a _commodity_ with a _lower composition_ of capital can be sold _under_ its _value_, then the "law of value" doesn't hold true neither.

### Total surplus value created by society and its relationship with the individual capitalist

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that Marx defines the relationship between capitalists and the total _surplus value_ created by society as a whole.

The quote from Marx starts with «Although the capitalists of the different spheres of production in selling their commodities get back the value of the capital used up in the production of these commodities they do not thereby recover the _surplus value_, and therefore profit, created in their own particular spheres, by the production of these commodities, but only so much surplus value, and therefore profit, as falls by an equal division to every aliquot part of the whole capital, from the total surplus value or total profit which the entire capital of society has created in a given time, in all the spheres of production taken together. Every 100 of invested capital, what- ever its composition, secures in every year, or other period of time, the profit which, for this period, falls due to a 100 as a given part of the total capital. So far as profit is concerned, the different capitalists are in the position of simple members of a joint stock company, in which the profits are divided into equal shares on every 100, and therefore for the different capitalists vary only according to the amount of capital invested by each in the common undertaking, according to the relative extent of his participation in the common business, according to the number of his shares» (Marx, 1894)

### Capitalist get the money they invested in production back

Let's clarify that large paragraph. First Marx tells us that "Although the capitalists of the different spheres of production in selling their commodities get back the value of the capital used up in the production of these commodities" meaning that when capitalists sell their goods, they recover the money they originally spent on production (e.g., raw material, labor, machinery depreciation).

### They don't keep the surplus value created in that specific industry

Then Marx continues with "they do not thereby recover the _surplus value_, and therefore profit, created in their own particular spheres, by the production of these commodities" meaning that even though they generate _surplus value_ (profit) in their own industries, they don't keep exactly what their industry produced.

### The total surplus value is gathered in a common pool and then distributed across capitalists in that industry

"but only so much surplus value", Marx continues, ", and therefore profit, as falls by an equal division to every aliquot part of the whole capital, from the total surplus value or which the capital of has created in a given time, in all the spheres of production taken together." Meaning that instead, the total surplus value generated by all industries is pooled together and then distributed equally across all capitalists, baed on their amount of capital they have invested.

### Every amount invested in that industry gets the same average rate of profit for all capitalists

Marx states that for "Every 100 of invested capital, whatever its composition, secures in every year, or other period of time, which, for this period, falls due to a 100 as a given part of the total capital." Meaning that regardless of that industry, every $100 of investment earns the same percentage of profit, based on the _average profit rate_ for all capitalists combined.

### Capitalists in an industry operate like shareholders in a company

Now Marx tells us that "So far as profit is concerned, the different capitalists are in the position of simple members of a joint stock company" Meaning that capitalists function like shareholders in a company, where profits are distributed based on the amount each person has invested.

### Capitalists get profits based on how much they invested in the economy as a whole

Finally he says "...in which the profits are divided into equal shares on every 100, and therefore for the different capitalists vary only according to of capital invested by each in the common undertaking, according to of his in the common business, according to the number of his shares". Meaning that just like shareholders get dividends based on how many shares they own, capitalists receive profits based on how much capital they have invested in the economy as a whole.

### Definition of Average Rate of Profit

Böhm-Bawerk quotes Marx saying that the _average rate of profit_ is «the total amount of surplus value divided among the amounts of capital in every sphere of production in proportion to their quantities» (Marx, 1894).

We can break down that statement as the following set of mathematical definitions:

$$
\text{Total Surplus Generated in the Economy} =
S_{\text{total}}
$$

$$
\text{Total Capital Invested in all Industries} =
C_{\text{total}}
$$

$$
\text{Capital invested by capitalist in i} =
{C_i}
$$

$$
\text{Profit received by capitalist in i} =
p_i = \frac{C_i}{C_{\text{total}}}
$$

### Marx answers the question with another question

Böhm-Bawerk once again tells us that Marx answers the question with another question «does this adjustment of profits to a common rate of profit take place, since it is evidently a result and not a starting point?» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p25)

### In pre-capitalist societies rates of profit don't equalized according to Marx

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that Marx answers this question taking us back to pre-capitalist societies, societies in which laborers not only own the means of production, but commodities are exchanged by according to their _values_. And due to these two conditions, _rates of profit_ could _not_ be equalized (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p25-26).

### [unfinished thought] repercussion

There's an important implication here. Since Marx declares that his "law of value" is akin to "natural law" and that "it imposes itself in the long run" it obvious that this behavior violates something fundamental. Perhaps this is the source of the disdain Marxists feel for the concept of _profit_: from the idea of "cheating" or "breaking a natural law".

This is also a common pattern in the Marxian system of thinking. When something is declared as a law it is common to encounter examples that contradict such law in logic or the physical world. But, instead of revisiting the validity of "the law", Marx dismisses such scenarios.
