"A first pass can be made over the requirements pon with a large mesh net to get all the big ones. You can get a feel for the needed software from the big requirements and then make a subsequent pass with a smaller mesh net and get the medium-sized requirements, still leaving the small ones for later. This metaphor works wether we think of size as business value, essentialness to the software, and so on."
