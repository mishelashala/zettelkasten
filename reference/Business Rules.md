## What are business rules

"Business rules describe the objects, relationships, and actions that a business finds important and worth writing down."

Rod Stephens, Beginning Database Design Solutions, p121

### Business Rules: Importance

"Business rules are an important component of the database. They contribute to overall data integrity and impose integrity constraints that are specific to the organization."

Database Design for Mere Mortals, p400

## How to design business rules

"You base a business rule on the way the organization perceives and uses its data, which you determine from the manner in which the organization functions or conducts its business."

Database Design for Mere Mortals, p370

## Business Rules are unique to each organization

"Each organization has its own data and information requirements, and each has its own unique way of conducting its business; therefore, every organization needs its own specific set of business rules."

Database Design for Mere Mortals, p370

## Business Rules: Integrity

"You're sure that each rule imposes a meaningful constraint."

Database Design for Mere Mortals, p448

## Business Rules: Types

"The two major types of business rules are database oriented and application oriented. Both types of business rules impose some form of constraint and help enforce and maintain overall data integrity, but they differ with regard to where and how they are stablished."

Database Design for Mere Mortals, p373

### Application-Oriented Business Rules

"[...] impose constraints that you cannot establish within the logical design of the database. You must instead establish them within the physical design of the database or within the design of a database application, where they will be more applicable and meaningful."

Database Design for Mere Mortals, p375

### Database-Oriented Business Rules

"[...] impose constraints that you can establish within the logical design of the database."
