"The wonderful thing about abstractions is that they represent common, stable qualities. They are less likely to change than are the concrete classes from which they are extracted. Depending on an abstraction is always safer than depending on a concretion because by its very nature, the abstraction is more stable."

Sandi Metz, Practical Object Oriented Design, p57
