## Dependency Rule

"[...] states that all dependencies between those layers must point inward."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p21

## Different Use Cases equals Different Input and output models

"[...] different use cases should have different input and output models, meaning that the types of the input parameters and types of the return values should be different."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean 
Architecture, p101

## Use Cases

"This means that the main domain logic is implemented in the use case classes."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p44

### Anti-Corruption Layer and Use Cases

"With validation located in the input model, we have created an anti-corruption layer around our use case implementation."
