## Broken Window Theory

"When working on a low-quality code base, the threshold to add more low-quality code is low."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean 
Architecture, p100

## Maintainability

"If software is maintainable, that means it's easy to change. If it's easy to change, it's flexible and probably modular."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p2

### Maintainability supports functionality

"[...] maintainability is a key supporter of functionality. Bad maintainability means that changes in functionality become more and more expensive over time."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p3

### Don't compromise maintainability

"[...] our software needs to provide value. But it shouldn't provide value at the cost of maintainability."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p3

### Maintainable code is easier to test

"[...] maintainability implies testability because maintainable software is most likely design from smaller and simpler components that make testing easy."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p2

### When change causes pain

"In a not-so-maintainable software system, changes in functionality will soon become so expensive that change is a pain."

Tom Hombergs, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture, p3

## Internal Quality

"The degree to which software code is well organized and maintainable corresponds to its internal quality"
