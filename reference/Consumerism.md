# Leisure as consumption

"The Hoover Commission agreed. Leisure was not, in fact, an excuse to relax. It was a hole to fill up with more wants (which, in turn, required more work to pay for them)."

# Our relationship with money and consumerism

"We project onto money the capacity to fulfill our fantasies, allay our fears, soothe our pain, and send us soaring to new heights. In fact, we now meet most of our needs, wants, and desires through money. We buy everything from hope to happiness. We no longer live life. We consume it."
