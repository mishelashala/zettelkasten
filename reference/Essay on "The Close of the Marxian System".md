### The Marxian definition of commodities

Böhm-Bawerk states that Marx limits the definition of commodities in order to distinguish them from other economic goods, he tells us that «[Marx] limits from the beginning to _commodities_, by which, according to him, we are not to understand all economic goods, but only those _products of labor_ which are made for the market.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p9, _Emphasis is ours_).

In other words, the difference between a commodity and any other economic good (land, natural resources, etc) is that commodities contain human labor within them, and the rest of economics god don't. This point will be central to Böhm-Bawerk's critic.

### The duality of a commodity

Böhm-Bawerk expands on the duality of a commodity. First he tells us that «A commodity is, on one side, a useful thing, which by its properties satisfies human wants of some kind and», he continues, «on the other, it forms the material medium of exchange value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p9).

The first property (being a useful thing) is called a "use value". The second property (being a material medium of exchange value) is called an "exchange value".

### What Determines the value of commodities

Böhm-Bawerk explains us that the core idea behind Marx's labor value of theory is as follows: «the whole value of commodities was based on the labor embodied in them» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p4).

### Definition of exchange value

For a better understanding of the concept of exchange value Böhm-Bawerk quotes Marx directly: «Exchange value presents itself in the first instance as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which values in use of one kind are exchange for values in use of another kind» (Marx, 1887).

In other words, If a were to exchange a use value **A** for a use value of **B**, the exchange value would be how much of B I would get for A, or viceversa.

Marx continues by explaining that «a relation which constantly changes with time and place.» (Marx, 1887). In other words, just because today in Italy _use value_ **A** is exchange for _x_ of _use value_ **B** doesn't mean that tomorrow that exchange rate will be the same. And that just because in Italy the exchange rate is _x_ doesn't mean that in Spain the exchange rate has to be the same.

### The accidental nature of exchange values

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that due to the constantly changing nature of exchange values due to time and place «Exchange value, therefore, appears to be something accidental.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p10).

How can commodities have always changing relation exchanges? He then tells us: «And yet there must be in this changing relation something that is stable and unchanging.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p10).

### A common factor for all commodities

He relies on Marx to explain this stable and unchanging something present in all commodities: «[...] there exists a common factor of the same magnitude in two different things, in a quarter of wheat and in cwt. of iron. The two things are therefore equal to a third which is in itself neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, so far as it is an exchange value, must therefore be reducible to that third.» (Marx, 1887).

In this passage Marx goes into deducing by law of transitivity there must be a common factor for all exchange relations. If commodity _A_ can be exchanged by _B_, and _B_ can be exchanged by _C_, then commodity _A_ can be exchanged by commodity _C_.

### The nature of the common factor

The quote from Marx continues with «This common factor cannot be a geometrical, physical, chemical or other natural property of the commodities.» (Marx, 1887).

At this point Marx, nor Böhm-Bawerk have not explained (yet) why this property has to be non-physical. So this stays as a open question to be answered.

One thing to note here is that this point of contingency will also be relevant when Böhm-Bawerk discusses Werner Sombert's apology in the last chapter.

All we can say for now is that the implication from that passage is that the common factor, therefore, has to be metaphysical.

### The role of physical properties in commodities

Once established the idea that the common factor has to be metaphysical, then what can be said about physical properties?

Marx tells us that «[the] physical properties [of commodities] come into consideration for the most part only in so far as they make the commodities useful, and so make them values in use.» (Marx, 1887, _clarification is ours_).

In other words, the physical properties of commodities is what makes them useful. It is the ability of an iron cast pan to get hot what gives it its ability to be used for cooking. With different physical properties, or none of the necessary physical properties for cooking, whatever thing we had in hand would not be of use.

Take a sheet of paper as an example. It doesn't have the shape, the material, nor the burning point of an iron cast pan. The physical properties of such sheet of paper make it useless for cooking.

### Values of use "don't" determine exchange relations

Marx continues by stating that «the exchange relation of commodities is obviously determined without reference to their values in use.» (Marx, 1887).

In other words, when determining the exchange relations of commodity _A_ in correspondence with commodity _B_ we don't care about the physical properties of the commodities.

> Note: this point seems counter intuitive

### Values in use and exchange values are mutually exclusive

For Marx value in use and values are mutually exclusive. He leaves that clear when he states that «As values in use commodities are above everything of different quality; as exchange values they can only be of different quantity, and they can, therefore, contain no atom of value in use.» (Marx, 1887)

In other words, when we exchange something is because we render that commodity completely useless. When we exchange a cast iron pan for a set of cooking knifes we are implying that not a single atom in that cast iron pan is of use for us.

With this Marx re-iterates his previous point that this common factor between commodities is not physical, but metaphysical.

### "Reaching" a common factor by elimination

Marx continues by saying that «If we then abstract from the value in use of commodities, there remains to them only one common property, that of being products of labor.» (Marx, 1887).

This is where, according to Böhm-Bawerk, the first critical fallacy of the Marxian system appears.

If we remember, at the beginning Böhm-Bawerk references the definition of _commodity_ that Marx gave. And leaves clear that Marx defines a commodity as only the exchange goods that are product of human labor, leaving out natural resources and non-labor based exchange goods.

Now, that Marx is looking for a common factor for exchange rates he "reaches" the conclusion that has to be "being products of human labor".

This is one of the principal criticisms that Böhm-Bawerk makes to the Marxian system: that its definition of commodity and exchange rates rely on circular logic: all commodities are the product of human labor, human labor is the common factor in all commodities.

### The process of elimination

Let's continue with the process by which Marx reached out this conclusion. Marx tells us that «if we abstract from the value in use of a commodity, we at the same time abstract from the material constituents and forms which give it a value in use. It is no longer a table, or a house, or yarn, or any other useful thing. All its physical qualities have disappeared.» (Marx, 1887).

This statement is supported by two previous ideas. Fist, that _values_ and _use values_ are mutually exclusive. And, second, that when we determine exchange relations we only care about the _value_ and not the _value in use_.

Without those two pre-requisites this process of elimination is rendered useless. But, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that both premises are true.

### All physical properties are gone

Marx continues by stating that the commodities are «[no] longer the product of the labor or the carpenter, or the mason, or the spinner, or of any other particular productive industry. With the useful character of the labor products here disappears the useful character of the labors embodied in them, and there vanish also the different concrete forms of these labors.» (Marx, 1887, _clarification is ours_).

This passage hints a future dichotomy in Marxian thinking: concrete human labor vs abstract human labor. By process of elimination the concrete human labors becomes abstract human labor.

Marx concludes by saying that «[commodities] are no longer distinguished from each other, but are all reduced to identical human labor—abstract human labor.» (Marx, 1887, _clarification is ours_).

### A clear definition of value

Böhm-Bawerk considers abstract human labor the true definition of value within the Marxian system. He tells us «With this then we have the conception of value discovered and determined.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11).

On so far we have reached a definition of value, this seems odd, due to the fact that Böhm-Bawerk jumped from Marx's discussion about determining the _common factor_ in _exchange_ relations, to a process of elimination to determine it, to a definition of _value_. But _value_ was not the thing that was being discussed.

### Value is not the same as exchange value

To this, Böhm-Bawerk tells us that _value_ «is in dialectical form not identical with exchange value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11).

He then elaborates further by saying _value_ «is a kind of logical distillation from» _exchange relation_ (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11).

Nor Marx, nor Böhm-Bawerk explanation seem to be clear enough. What is the relation between _value_ and _exchange value_ in this context?

### Exchange value is a form of value

Böhm-Bawerk tries to clarify by quoting Marx: «the exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed» (Marx, 1887, p45).

With this we have a better understanding of the relation between _value_ and _exchange value_. For the Marxian system _value_ is a metaphysical entity that can only be expressed physically y _exchange value_.

### Commensurability of exchange value

Since value a metaphysical property it cannot be measured in any way. But _exchange value_ by being a physical expression of _value_ can.

### How do we measure exchange value

Böhm-Bawerk tell us that «As labor is the substance of value so the amount of the value of all goods is measured by the quantity of labor contained in them, which is, in its turn, measure by its duration» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p11-12).

Again, we see the use of the law of transitivity. Since _exchange value_ can be measured by _human labor_, and _human labor_ can be measured in _time_, therefore we can measure _exchange value_ using _time_.

### Definition of Working time

But when both, Marx and Böhm-Bawerk, say that _time_ is the measure of _exchange value_ how are they measuring time?

Böhm-Bawerk, again, quotes Marx to clarify how _time_ is measured in commodities. Marx defines that _time_ as the «working time required to produce value in use under the normal conditions of production, and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society"» (Marx, 1887, p46).

Let's unpack this definition.

First, the phrase "working time required to produce value in use under the normal conditions of production". It seems obvious that the time it would take a worker to produce a commodity in _normal circumstances_ (he has all the necessary tools and resources, his tools are in a good state, etc) is different from someone that doesn't (he doesn't have all the tools and resources, his tools are broken, etc).

Second, the phrase "and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society". A worker using a "state of the art" method or machinery not available to every worker would require a different amount of working time than his peers or to other workers in a different country.

### Socially necessary working time

There's a point of contingency that every first-time reader of the Marxian system encounters when reading the definition of _exchange value_, that is: any worker could artificially increase the "value" of his commodity by increasing the amount of time it takes to create it by finding ways to take "longer".

Marx shields his definition by stating that «it is only the quantity of socially necessary labor, or the working time socially necessary for the production of a value in use, which determines the amount of the value.» (Marx, 1887).

Meaning that all the "unnecessary" time in the production of a _commodity_ has no effect in the _exchange value_ of the commodity.

### Same working time as the common factor

Finally, Marx tells us that «Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labor are embodied, or which can be produced in the same working time, have the same value.», (Marx, 1887).

From this have finally come to the common factor in _exchange relations_: socially necessary working time. Two commodities have the same _exchange value_ when they have the same _socially necessary working time_ embodied in them.

### The law of value

This is what Böhm-Bawerk calls "Marx's law of value". According to Böhm-Bawerk, this law «states, and must state, after what has gone before, that commodities are exchanged in proportion to the socially necessary working time incorporated in them.», (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p12).

### The law of value and the law of supply and demand

Böhm-Bawerk let us know that within the Marxian system supply and demand are considered as constant oscillations of the prices, but these «constant oscillations of market prices [...] compensate and cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average prices as their inner law» (Marx, 1887, p184).

The concept of _cancelling each other_ is important both in the Marxian system and in Böhm-Bawerk's criticism of such system as we'll see later.

In the meantime we can say that by labelling supply and demand as "constant oscillations of market prices" Marx recognizes the existence of supply and demand. But saying that they "cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average prices" implies that supply and demand doesn't have an effect in market prices, and that the law of value prevails.

### The law of value imposes itself over time

As Böhm-Bawerk quotes directly from Marx: «the socially necessary working time always asserts itself by main force, like an overruling natural law, in the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations.» (Marx, 1887, p86).

### The "law of value" as a "natural and eternal law"

For Böhm-Bawerk, Marx is treating his "law of value" a kin to a natural, and eternal law. To make his case he quotes Marx saying «eternal law of exchange of commodities» (Marx, 1887, p215). Then he quotes Marx saying «the natural law of equilibrium», (Marx, 1894, p221).

## The surplus value doctrine

For Böhm-Bawerk the "law of value" is the first pillar in the Marxian system. From this "law of value" Marx deduces the second pillar his system: the doctrine of _surplus value_ (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

### What is the main teaching of this theory of surplus value

For Böhm-Bawerk the purpose of his doctrine of _surplus value_ is to know where _surplus value_ is coming from (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

### How capitalists operate

Böhm-Bawerk explains the capitalist cycle as follows: «Capitalists lay down a certain sum of money, convert it into commodities, and then—with or without an intermediate process of production—convert these back again into more money.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

### Profit doesn't come from buying commodities under their value

Böhm-Bawerk explains us that under the Marxian system profit doesn't come from the seller buying commodities at a price below market price: «He [Marx] first declares that the surplus value cannot originate either in the fact that the capitalist, as a buyer, buys commodities regularly under their value» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13, _clarification is ours_).

In other words, _profit_, in the Marxian system, doesn't come from the capitalist buying a commodity _A_ with an exchange value of _x_ at price _x - y_, and then selling that same commodity at _x_. In this scenario the _profit_ of the capitalist would be _y_.

### Profit doesn't come from selling commodities over their value

But since that is ruled out impossible within the Marxian system we could be tempted to think that it can come from selling the commodities _over their value_. But, Böhm-Bawerk leaves clear that, within the Marxian system, that is also impossible. He tells us that sources of _profit_ doesn't align with «the fact that the capitalist, as a seller, sells them over their value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13).

Therefore, it is impossible for a capitalist to buy a _commodity_ _A_ at value _x_ and then sell it at _x + y_, making the profit of the capitalist _y_.

### Theory of surplus value relies on the "law of value"

These two scenarios bring us the immediate question: but why? Within the Marxian system, the "law of value" is always reigning supreme, therefore _commodities_ **always** exchange _at their value_. The "law of value" rules out impossible those two scenarios: buying under value, and selling over value.

Marx tells us explicitly that «The owner of the money must buy the commodities at their value, then sell them at their value» (Marx, 1894, p185).

### If the "law of value" is false, then the doctrine of surplus value is false

Therefore, the doctrine of surplus value is completely dependent of the "law of value". If the "law of value" is false, then the doctrine of _surplus value_ is false. This is a point that Böhm-Bawerk doesn't explore in his work, but it is deducible from his explanation of the Marxian system and Marx's own words.

### The problem Marx is trying to solve

Marx continues by telling us that «and yet at the end of the process [the capitalist] must draw out more money than he put in. Such is the conditions of the problem» (Marx, 1894, p185).

This problem, again, is: where does profit originates?

### The problem is the result of the "law of value"

Marx operates under the premise that the "law of value" is true, therefore, he looks perplexed at this "magic trick" that originates: money coming out nowhere.

But if we remove the law of value, in other words, if we declare the law of value as false, then problem disappears. Without the "law of value" then the possibility of buying _commodities_ _under_ their value, and/or selling commodities _over_ their value can become an excellent explanation for the source of _profit_.

### The dishonest conflation of profit and surplus value

This is a good moment to make a parenthesis. In the same way that Marx purposely limits the range of a _commodity_ to get the result he wants, he conflates _profit_ and _surplus value_.

Within the Marxian system _surplus value_ and _profit_ are used interchangeably. But they are not the same. The term _surplus value_ is a loaded term. It implies that extra _value_ has been added to a _commodity_. And, as discussed earlier, _labor_ is what determines _value_ within the Marxian system.

By **always** using _surplus value_ when talking about _profit_ Marx is limiting the sources of _profit_ exclusively to _labor_, ruling out other possible sources. By doing so he gets the conclusion he already wanted, just as he did with the definition of _commodity_.

By ruling out the "law of value" as false, we then can discuss other sources of profit, rendering the whole doctrine of _surplus value_ as false.

### The theory of exploitation depends on the theory of surplus value

Just as the doctrine of _surplus value_ relies on the "law of value" and the _labor value theory_ being true, the doctrine of _exploitation_ relies on the doctrine of _surplus value_ being true.

If the "law of value" is false, or the theory of _labor value theory_ is false, then the doctrine of _surplus value_ is false. If the theory of _surplus value_ is false, then the theory of _exploitation_ is false.

### Labor power as the source of surplus value

But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let's get back to the problem of identifying the source of _surplus value_.

Böhm-Bawerk tells us that, in fact, Marx found a solution: labor power. He tells us that «there is one commodity whose value in use possesses that peculiar property of being a source of exchange value. This commodity is the capacity of labor, labor power.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p13-14).

### Labor power as a commodity

He continues by saying that «[labor power] is offered for sale in the market under the twofold condition that the laborer is personally free, for otherwise it would not be his labor power only that would be for sale, but his whole person as a slave; and that the laborer is destitute of», here he's quoting Marx, «all the means necessary for the realizing of his labor power".» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14, _clarification is ours_).

In other words, laborers sell their _labor power_ as a _commodity_ in the market as free men under two conditions. The first one: they sell their whole body as slaves; the second one: they have to sell it because they don't own the means of production necessary to realize their labor as independent agents.

### Laborers send their labor power because they don't own means of production

Böhm-Bawerk makes emphasis in the second condition by stating «for otherwise [they] would prefer to produce on [their] own account and to offer for sale [their] products rather than [their] labor power» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14, _clarification is ours_).

This is a crucial point in the Marxian system: the idea that laborers are forced to sell their _labor force_ instead of selling their _commodities_ because they don't have any other option. In other words, they are trapped in their condition of laborers because of the material conditions. Change the material conditions by granting them control over the means of production and they gladly and without hesitation would sell their commodities one hundred percent of the time over selling their labor power.

### Surplus value comes from trading labor power

Böhm-Bawerk continues by saying that «it is by trading in this commodity that the capitalist obtains the _surplus value_.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

Here, we can see the circular logic in action again. By conflating the term _surplus value_ with _profit_ Marx glides us to the conclusion he wants.

If _profit_ cannot come from other sources but _surplus value_, and _surplus value_ is _labor added_ to a commodity, then he already had his conclusion prepared without having to search for it: _surplus value_ can only come from _labor power_.

### The regulation of labor power

_Labor power_ by virtue of being a commodity «is regulated like any other commodity by the working time necessary for its reproduction», (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

In this context the "working time necessary for its reproduction" would mean the minimum amount of food, shelter, and rest a worker would need in order to replenish his energies.

### The capitalist buys the labor power to make it work for him

Böhm-Bawerk then tells us that «If the capitalist has concluded this purchase, the value in use of the labor power belongs to him and he realizes it by causing the laborer to work for him.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

Meaning that once acquired the labor power through a financial transaction the capitalist can use that labor power as he wishes.

### Following the "law of value" would lead to no profit

«But if [the capitalist]», Böhm-Bawerk continues ,«made [the laborer] work only so many hours a day as are embodied in the labor power itself, and as must have been paid for in the buying of the same, no surplus value would arise» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

Here, Böhm-Bawerk, explains the concept of _appropriation of surplus value_ by the capitalist.

This premise relies both in the "law of value" being and the doctrine of _surplus value_ of being true. It relies on the "law of value" because all _commodities_ **must** exchange by their equal.

In the case of the "law of value": if a capitalist is buying eight hours of work, then the laborer must give the equivalent _value_ in commodities. And viceversa, if a laborer is selling eight hours work, then capitalist must receive the equivalent _value_ in _commodities_.

And in the case of the doctrine of _surplus value_: if the laborer adds three extra hours of labor to an commodity, then he must receive those three hours of work from the capitalist in exchange.

This two conditions would lead to an "equilibrium" in which each part is receiving exactly the same value, therefore, producing no surplus value for the capitalist nor the laborer. Equals exchanging for equals.

### The real source of profit: unpaid labor

«But this is not the way in which capitalists act», Böhm-Bawerk tells us. «Even if they have bought the labor power for a price which only corresponds to six hour's working time, they yet make the laborer work the whole day for them.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

This is where the _modus operandi_ of the capitalists is described. Under the interpretation of the Marxian system _profit_ comes from unpaid labor. The capitalist pays for certain amount of hours, but then make the laborer work for longer.

### Profit breaks the "law of value"

«And now in the product made during this day there are incorporated more hours of labor than the capitalist was obligated to pay for.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p14).

This is where the "law of value" is broken for the Marxian system. Given that the "law of value" states that equals must be exchanged for equals, by receiving more from the laborer than what they are exchanging for they create a disequilibrium.

That disequilibrium can be expressed as follows: the laborer is producing _X_ value in commodities, but the capitalist is giving to the laborer _Y_. But _Y_ is not equal to _X_, but _X - Z_. Therefore they would not be exchanging _X_ for _Y_, in other words _X_ for _X_, but _X_ for _X - Z_. That _Z_ is the _surplus value_ added by the worker that is being not remunerated to him, in other words, it is being appropriated by the capitalist.

### [unfinished thought] repercussion

There's an important implication here. Since Marx declares that his "law of value" is akin to "natural law" and that "it imposes itself in the long run" it obvious that this behavior violates something fundamental. Perhaps this is the source of the disdain Marxists feel for the concept of _profit_: from the idea of "cheating" or "breaking a natural law".

---

### Where does surplus value comes from

From those two definitions an obvious question arises: if value is determined by the labor embodied in them, and commodities are exchanged in proportion with the labor they contain. Then, where does profit comes from?

### It doesn't come from the constant capital

He then tells us that for the Marxian system of thought «the amount of surplus value was not in proportion to the whole amount of the capital employed by the capitalist» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p4), in other words: surplus value doesn't come from the investment in capital made by the capitalist on means of production (machinery, tools, land, etc.). This is what is referred as constant capital in the Marxian system.

### It comes from variable capital

But if it doesn't come from the capital, where does it come from? He then complements the first statement by saying «but only to the amount of the "variable" part—that is, to that part of capital paid in wages» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p4). Meaning that surplus value can only come from the workers. This is what is referred as variable capital in the Marxian system.

### Böhm-Bawerk makes re-emphasises this point

He stresses this point at the end of the sentence by saying «the "constant capital," the capital employed in the purchase of the means of production added no value.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p4). This leaves no room for interpretation. The Marxian system is very clear cut about the topic.

Surplus value can only come from variable capital, not from constant capital. Period.

### [uncomplete thought] how does the capitalist ends up keeping the surplus value

Böhm-Bawerk argues that the Marxist view on this is clear: «the profit or surplus value falling to the capitalist was the fruit of extortion practiced on the worker.» (Böhm-Bawerk, 1949, p4)
