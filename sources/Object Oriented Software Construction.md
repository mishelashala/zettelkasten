## Notes

### External Quality Factors

«such qualities as speed or ease of use, whose presence or absence in software product may be detected by its users. These properties may be called **external** quality factors.», p3

### Internal Quality Factors

«Other qualities applicable to a software product, such as being modular, or readable, are **internal** factors, perceptible only to computer professionals who have access to the actual software text.», p3

### Internal vs External Quality Factors

«the key to achieving these external factors is in the internal ones: for the user to enjoy the visible qualities, the designers and implementers must have applied internal techniques that will ensure the hidden qualities.», p3

### Not loosing the big picture

«We should not, however, lose track of the global picture; the internal techniques are not an end in themselves, but a means to reach external software qualities.», p4

### Definition of Correctness

«Correctness is the ability of software products to perform their exact tasks, as defined by their specification.», p4
