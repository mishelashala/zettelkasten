## Notes

### Definition of Habit

«Habit is ‘knowledge in the hands’ that readies the understanding body for meaningful interface with the world.», p80-81

### The invisible in jiu jitsu

«Objective and macro elements of these positions may be gleaned through mere observation, but the fine gradations of feel and leverage that render the techniques effective and efficient are largely invisible and thus must be discerned through a body that is acting and reacting to stimulus.», p81

### The mat doesn't lie

«In BJJ, study that is detached from immersion in the grappling milieu is a poor substitute for authentic bodily immersion in combative space.», p81

### The uke as an extension of one-self

«Training partners are vital to the process of assimilating BJJ habits and developing a grappler’s corporeal schema. As we will see, this ‘other’ becomes an extension of the self.», p81

### Habits and the body

«habits enable our bodies to gear with the demands of our worlds and to seamlessly weave their way through space.», p84

### Only prepared bodies can understand the significance of being fully immersed

«Only bodies that are fully immersed in this space acquire the requisite corporeal schema to grasp its significance.», p84

### Habit can be acquired thru physical activity

«Habit is not won solely through imagination or intellectual engagement.», p84

### Habit requires physical engagement

«I can read about how to perform a particular hold or dream about 100 chokes, but until my body experiences the feel of the kimono, the angle of my opponent’s body, the comportment of my hands and the opponent’s resistance, the movement will not be fully assimilated into my body and activated when appropriate. My body will not perceive its essence and will not have understood.», p84

### The role of habit

«Habit permits smooth navigation and negotiation of subjects’ worlds. It is what allows for pre-reflective negotiating and navigating the world.», p84

### How familiarity operates

«The organist’s body understands and comprehends its situation as being familiar – it catches on. Familiar demands placed on the body initiate or activate the embodied ‘habits’ that have been ingrained over years of practice.», p84

### "Heideggerian" view of BJJ

«With each BJJ practice my body is being pulled ahead of itself to a future time to come – a time I cannot yet foresee.», p85

### Understanding what is being demanded to the body

«Habit entails a body that grasps the significance of particular movements. Thus, only through repeating the arm-lock movement and drilling the position with training partners of different sizes and shapes did my body come to understand what was being demanded.», p85

### Motor and perceptual are required to operate efficiently in the world

«Efficient being in the world requires the meshing of the motor and the perceptual in a way that pulls the individual body into the future (Weiner 1990).», p85
