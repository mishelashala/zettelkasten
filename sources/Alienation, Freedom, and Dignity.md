## Notes

### Life centered around "absurd" work

«As Castoriadis once put it, capitalism has the peculiarity of having (more than any previous economic system) made work utterly central to people's lives while at the same time having the tendency to render it "absurd"—a site of frustration of people's self-determination and self-realization rather than a medium for their expression.»

### Criticism: lack of control, lack of personal development, "intrumental" relationships

«They do not control their productive activities, their talents and creative potentials are stunted rather than unfolded, and they relate to their bosses, other workers and consumers in primarily instrumental and even hostile ways rather than on terms of mutual service or fellowship.»

### Practical issue: lack of identification

«The lack of identification of people with their working lives—remains an important practical issue.»

###  Presupposition: trans-historical, constant features of human nature is false

«it seems to presuppose a false essentialist picture of human beings as somehow having certain trans-historical, constant features that define them independently of how they shape and see themselves in their various social contexts.»

### The critique of alienation is not clear about its purpose

«it is not clear whether judgments about alienation are prudential judgments about the good life or moral judgments about right and wrong conduct and institutions, and how judgments of the two types should relate in the critique of alienation.»

### Paternalistic view of alienation

«the critique of alienation seems to lead to favoring paternalistic imposition of forms of life on those deemed to be alienated, and thus to disrespect their freedom to author their own lives.»

### Democratic system = alienated work good

«alienated work may not be problematic if the institutions underpinning it are democratically authorized.»

### The argument behind the thesis

«I argue that human dignity grounds a solidaristic requirement to support positive freedom, which enables people to counter alienation.»

### Human dignity; the reason behind re-organizing society

«we have reason to organize social life in such a way that we respond appropriately to the valuable features of individual human beings that give rise to their dignity.»

### Basic idea of alienation

«"alienation" is used to refer to a state or process of separation or division—lack of unity, harmony, or connectedness.»

### When the separation happens

«This disunity occurs between a subject S and some object O in certain circumstances.»

### The subject of alienation

«S is usually taken to be a person or an agent capable of self-knowledge and self-assessment.»

### The object of alienation

«O, in turn, may be aspects of the natural world, other people, or the agent themselves.»

### The conditions of alienation

«C, finally, may range over various material and social background factors.»

### Kinds of alienation

«Alienation may be subjective or objective.»

### Subjective alienation and the attitude of the subject

«Judgements about subjective alienation make ineliminable references to the attitudes of S (to S's desires, beliefs, or experience). They say, for example, that S _feels_ a lack of unity with O.»

### The four (4) possible scenarios

«As pointed out by Leopold, this distinction generates four possible cases for consideration.»

### Scenario A

«There could be (a) subjective alienation and objective alienation»

### Scenario B

«(b) no subjective alienation but objective alienation»

### Scenario C

«(c) subjective alienation but no objective alienation»

### Scenario D

«(d) neither subjective nor objective alienation»

### Marx focuses on Scenario A

«Marx tends to focus on case (a), in which workers fail to develop their capacities for free and solidaristic cooperation and feel dissatisfied with such a condition.»

### Hegel focuses on Scenario C

«Hegel, in turn, tends to focus on (c), saying that agents fail to understand the reasonability of their predicament.»

### Where Marx and Hegel agree and disagree

«Both Marx and Hegel yearn for a society in which (d) holds, but they construe the change leading to differently»

### The difference in methods for both Marx and Hegel

«with Hegel seeing it mostly as a matter of change in self-understanding, and Marx as requiring also a change in material and social circumstances.»

### Scenario B: happy without self-realization

«Finally, case (b) has been explored by critical theorists from the Frankfurt School tradition, who are particularly attuned to scenarios in which agents fail to act autonomously and self-realize but happen to be rather content.»

### Marx on alienation

«According to Marx, people are self-alienated when their actual condition is at odds with their human nature—wether they are aware of it or not.»

### Marx on Human Nature

«Marx takes human beings to have certain capacities for activities that are freely chosen, self-conscious, creative, individually differentiated, sensuously sophisticated, and socially cooperative and beneficial.»

### When humans face alienation according to Marx

«They face alienation when, and to the extent that the development and exercise of these capacities is frustrated.»

### Alienated Labor: Scenario 2

«do not control (or even understand) the social process of production, its mechanisms, and results»

### Alienated Labor: Scenario 3

«do not develop and exercise their creative powers and talents»

### Alienated Labor: Scenario 4

«interact with others in ways that are not mutually supportive and cooperative»

### Alienated Labor: Scenario 5

«do not count among the final aims of production the fulfilling of the needs of fellow human beings»

### Alienated Labor: Scenario 6

«do not garner social appreciation or recognition»

### Work as an instrumental activity

«The activity of production is for the workers mostly of instrumental relevance (a means to get a salary to pay for subsistence and other consumption goods)»

### Why alienated work is not intrinsically valuable

«It is not intrinsically valuable because it does not offer a medium to cultivate and deploy their abilities.»

### Instrumentalized social relationships

«The instrumentalizing attitude is also paramount across the human relationships shaping economic life. Other people are relevant mostly as means for self-advancement.»

### How social relationships are structured

«There is a tendency to give only in order to receive, and to give as little as possible to get as much as possible.»

### Where appreciation comes from

«one is mostly appreciated by how much one owns and by the power one has over others, not by the intrinsic significance of what one produces and by the contribution it makes to the well-being of others.»

### Claim: Alienation for everyone

«A social structure pushing people to live in this way generates alienation for everyone, including the oppressors—all are at odds with their inner tendencies towards freedom and cooperative sociality.»

### Descriptive accounts of alienation

«Descriptive claims about alienation report that there is disunity between S and O.»

### Normative accounts of alienation

«Normative claims go further, adding that some disunities are worthy of criticism.»

### Implication of normative accounts of alienation

«Normative accounts of alienation assume, or explicitly put forward, views about the positive value of some instances of unity, and about what the components, form, and justification of the unity should be.»

### Background circumstances in alienation

«Marx argues that facts about the background circumstances C help explain why workers are at odds with themselves and others as they produce.»

### Features of the background circumstances

«Marx highlights three important features of such circumstances: the property relations regarding the control of productive forces, the orientation of production and consumption, and the level of technological development.»

### Alienation occurs when the background circumstances are

«There is alienation if the level of technological development is relatively low, the property relations are not egalitarian, and the orientation of production and consumption is predominantly instrumental and self-centered.»

### Alienations is reduced when the background circumstances change

«alienation is reduced as technological development, coupled with more egalitarian relations of production and non-instrumental orientations, allow people to organize their production and consumption in ways that enable all to steer their own lives and flourish.»

### Types of normative claims of alienation

«Normative accounts may be of at least two kinds: prudential and moral.»

### Prudential's view

«Alienation may be criticized on prudential terms by saying that a lack of unity between S and O is a strike against S's well-being.»

###

«moral criticisms say that the disunity involves wrongdoing, that S is treated by other agents (and perhaps even by S themselves) in ways that contravene duties which are morally justified.»
