## Notes

### What Alienation describes

«The concept of alienation identifies a distinct kind of psychological or social ill; namely, one involving a problematic separation between a self and other that belong together.»

### What Alienation refers to

«'Alienation', and its cognates, could variously refer: to an individual's estrangement from God (it appears thus in the Wycliffle Bible); to legal transfers of ownership rights (initially, specially in land); and to mental derangement (a historical connection that survived into the nineteenth-century usage of the term 'alienist' for a psychiatric doctor).»

### Alienation simplified

«it understands alienation as consisting in the problematic separation of a subject and object that belong together.»

### Elements of alienation

«The characterisation of alienation offered here [...] involves three constituent elements: a subject, an object, and the relation between them.»

### The subject of alienation

«the _subject_ here is a self; typically, but not necessarily, a person, an individual agent.»

### Subject as a group

«'Not necessarily' because the subject could also be, for instance, a group of some kind.»

### The Object of alienation

«the relevant _object_ can take a variety of forms. These include: entities which are not a subject; another subject or subjects; and oneself.»

### Examples of objects of alienation

«Beatrice might be alienated from the natural world, from a social practice, from an institution, or from a social norm, where none of those entities are understood as agents of any kind.»

### The relationship of alienation

«the _relation_ is one of problematic separation between a subject and object that belong together.»

### All three elements are required in order to be alienation

«All of these elements are required: there has to be a separation; the separation has to be problematic; and it has to obtain between a subject and object that properly belong together.»

### A problematic relationship is necessary, but not sufficient for there to be alienation

«The idea of _separation_ is important. Not all problematic relations between relevant entities involve alienation.»

### A separation is not necessarily problematic

«Separations between a subject and object do not necessarily appear problematic. Relations of indifference, for example, might or might not be problematic.»

### Appropriately Problematic Separation

«to be appropriately problematic—appropriate, that is, to constitute examples of alienation—the separations have to obtain between a subject and object that _properly_ belong together.»

### What constitutes an appropriately problematic separation

«the candidate separations have to frustrate or conflict with the proper harmony or connectedness between that subject and object.»

### What constitutes a harmonious relation

«To say that they properly belong together is to suggest that the harmonious or connected relation between the subject and object is rational, natural, or good.»

### What constitutes a conflicting relation

«And, in turn, that the separations frustrating or conflicting with that baseline condition, are correspondingly irrational, unnatural, or bad.»

### The need for establishing a harmonic baseline

«that is not yet to identify what might establish this baseline harmony as, say, rational, natural, or good.»

### Implication: Entities without almost nothing in common

«This basic idea of alienation appears to give us a diverse but distinct set of social and psychological phenomena; picking out a class of entities which might have little in common other than this problematic separation of subject and object.»

### Alienation: A diagnosis without treatment

«the problematic separations might indicate that something is awry with the self or social world, but do not, in themselves, offer an explation of, or suggest a solution to, those ills.»

### The "modesty" of the concept of alienation

«On this account, the basic idea of alienation looks conceptually rather modest.»

### There's no relation between different sources of alienation

«Nor, for instance, need there be any suggestion that the various forms of alienation identified by this account are necessarily related to each other; that, for example, they are all explained by the same underlying factor.»

### Prevalence of alienation in liberal societies

«alienation picks out an array of non-trivial social and psychological ills that are prevalent in modern liberal societies»

### Alienation is different from injustice

«the idea of 'alienation' is distinct from that of 'injustice' on which much modern liberal political philosophy is focused.»

### Implication: there's something deeply wrong with liberal societies

«The implied critical suggestion—that the concept of alienation reveals that something significant is awry with both liberal society and liberal understandings—looks far from trivial.»

### Conflating alienation with fetishism and objetification

«particular accounts of alienation both within and beyond those two traditions, are sometimes said—more or less plausibly—to conflate alienation either with fetishism, or with objectification.»

### Alienation is not fetishism nor objetification

«Even if some particular treatments of alienation do equate the relevant concepts with each other, alienation is better understood as synonymous with neither fetishism nor objectification.»

### They overlap, but they are not synonymous

«Rather, fetishism is only one form that alienation can take, and not all objectification involves alienation.»

### Definition of Fetishism

«'Fetishism' refers here to the idea of human creations which have somehow escaped (we might say that they have inappropriately separated out from) human control, achieved the appearance of independence, and come to enslave or dominate their creators.»

### Fetishism as a feature of modernity

«Marx sometimes treats the phenomenon of fetishism as a distinguishing feature of modernity; where previous historical epochs were characterised by the rule of persons over persons, capitalist society is characterised by the rule of things over persons.»

### The Fetishism of 'Market forces'

«Consider, for instance, the frequency with which 'market forces' are understood and represented within modern culture as something outside of human control, as akin to natural forces which decide our fate.»

### The Fetishism of Religious Consciousness

«The famous, and disarmingly simple, conclusion of Feuerbach's philosophical analysis of religious consciousness is that, in Christianity, individuals are worshipping the predicates of human nature, freed of their individual limitations and project onto an ideal entity. For Feuerbach, however, this is no purely intellectual error, but is rather ripe with social, political, and psychological consequences, as this 'deity' now comes to enslave and dominate us.»

### Religious Consciousness, alienation, and fetishism

«Religious consciousness, on this Feuerbachian account, looks to be a case where alienation takes the form of fetishism. That is, there is both a problematic separation here between subject and object (individuals and their own human nature), and it takes the form of human creation (the idea of species embodied in God) escaping our control, achieving the appearance of independence, and coming to enslave and dominate us.»

### The 'Fetishism' of Capital

«Capital takes on the appearance of an independent social power which determines what is produced, how it is produced, and the economic (and other) relations between producers.»

### Fetishism is a form of alienation

«rather than equating alienation and fetishism, fetishism is better thought of as a particular form that alienation might take.»

### Marxist theory of 'alienated' relation with the natural world

«Consider, for instance, the problematic separation sometimes said to exist between modern individuals and the natural world, as the former think of themselves and behave as if they were isolated, or cut off, or estranged, from the latter.»

### Marxist theory of 'Unalienated' relation with the natural world and others

«the appropriate relation between humankind and nature would involve not our instrumental domination of 'the other', but rather a sympathetic appreciation of our complex interdependence with the natural world of which we are, in reality, a part.»

### Alienation from the natural world, but not fetishism

«The inappropriate modern relation between humankind and nature here looks like an example of alienation—there is a problematic separation of self and other—but certain central characteristics of fetishism would appear to be absent.»

### No obvious domination relation

«Moreover, the impact of humankind of this particular separation does not comfortably suit the language of enslavement and domination.»

### We instrumentalize nature, instead of nature having tyranny over us

«Indeed, if anything, our inappropriate separation from the natural world seems to find expression in our own ruthlessly instrumental treatment of nature, rather than in nature's tyranny over us.»

### We objectify the natural world

«In the present context, objectification refers rather to the role of productive activity in mediating the evolving relationship between humankind and the natural world.»

### Our relation with nature

«humans beings confront the natural world from an original position of scarcity, struggling through productive activity of various kinds to change the material form of nature—typically through making things—in ways that make it better reflect and satisfy their own needs and interests.»

### We have a mutually transformative relation with nature

«In that evolving process, both the natural world and humankind come to be transformed.»

### Productive activity implies objectification

«On this account, all productive activity would seem to involve objectification.»

### To Marx not all productive activities take an alienated form

«Marx maintains that productive activity might or might not take an alienated form.»

### Productive work is 'unalienated' in communist societies

«For instance, productive activity in capitalists societies is typically said to take an alienated form; where as productive activity in communist societies is typically predicated to take an unalienated or meaningful form.»

### How alienated work looks like

«Schematically, we might portray alienated labour (characteristic of capitalist society) as: bein forced; not involving self-realisation (not developing and deploying essential human powers); not intended to satisfy the needs of others; and not appropriately appreciated by those others.»

### How 'unalienated' work looks like

«And, schematically, we might portray unalienated or meaningful work (characteristic of communist society) as: being freely chosen; involving self-realisation (the development and deployment of essential human powers); being intended to satisfy the needs of others; and being appropriately appreciated by those others.»

### Work as a 'necessary evil'

«work is seen as a necessary evil, an unpleasant activity unfortunately required for our survival.»

### Christian view: all work takes an alienated form

«It owes its name to Christianity's embrace of the claim that alienated work is part of the human condition: at leas since the Fall, human beings are required to work by the sweat of their brows.»

### The Christian view confuses alienation with objectification

«On Marx's account, or something like it, one might characterise this Christian view as mistakenly equating objectification and alienation, confusing productive activity as such with its stunted and inhuman forms.»

### What this socially alienated confusion tell us about Christianity

«this kind of confusion reflects the alienated social condition of humankind, embodying an emblematic failure to understand that material production is a central realm in which human beings can express, in free and creative ways, the kind of creatures that they are.»

### Some forms of alienation have nothing to do with productive activities

«according to the basic idea defended here, equating alienation and objectification fails to appreciate that certain forms of alienation might have nothing at all to do with productive activity.»

### Fetishism and objectification are not synonymous of alienation

«neither fetishism, nor objectification, are best construed as identical with alienation. Rather than being synonymous, these concepts only partially overlap.»

### How to understand fetishism

«Fetishism can be understood as picking out only a subset—on some accounts perhaps a large subset–of cases of alienation.»

### Objectification without alienation

«And there are forms of objectification which do not involve alienation—outside of productive activity—with no obvious connection to objectification.»

### Subjective Alienation

«alienation is sometimes characterised in terms of how subjects feel, or think about, or otherwise experience, the problematic here.»

### Objective Alienation

«alienation is sometimes characterised in terms which make no reference to the feelings, thoughts, or experience of subjects.»

### "Objective" Alienation can be controversial as a concept

«Such claims are controversial in a variety of ways, but they assume alienation is about the frustration of that potential, and they make no reference to whether Julieta herself experiences that lack as a loss.»

### Objective alienation without Subjective Alienation (?)

«Maybe Julieta genuinely enjoys her self-realisation-lacking life, and even consciously rejects the goal of self-realisation as involving an overly demanding and unattractive ideal.»

### Subjective Alienation vs Objective Alienation

«Subjective alienation is sometimes disparaged—treated, for example, as concerning 'merely' how an individual 'feels' about 'real' alienation.»

### Subjective alienation as a variety of alienation

«subjective alienation is better understood as full-blown, meaningful, variety of alienation, albeit not the only one. If you genuinely feel alienated, then you really are (subjectively) alienated.»

### For Marx capitalist societies experience both objective and subjective alienation at the same time

«Marx can be characterised as diagnosing contemporary society as corresponding to situation (i); that is, as being a social world which contains objective and subjective alienation.»

### For Marx Subjective and Objective alienation as different, but present at the same time

«Marx allows that objective and subjective alienation are conceptually distinct, but assumes that in capitalist societies they are typically found together sociologically.»

### For Marx Subjective and Objective alienation can occur from each other

«However, there are passages where he deviates from that standard view, and—without abandoning the thought that objective alienation is, in some sense, more fundamental—appears to allow that, on occasion, subjective and objective alienation can also come apart sociologically.»

### For Hegel he lived in a society without objective alienation, but subjective alienation

«Hegel maintains that the modern social world approximates to something more like situation (iii); that is, as being a social world not containing objective alienation, but still containing subjective alienation.»

### For Hegel the modern world feels like a home (zu Hause)

«for Hegel, the social and political structures of the modern social world do constitute a home, because they enable individuals to realise themselves, variously as family members, economic agents, and citizens.»

### 'Pure Subjective Alienation' in the real world

«However, those same individuals fail to understand or appreciate that this is the case, and rather feel estranged from, and perhaps even consciously reject, the institutions of the modern social world. The resulting situation has been characterised as one of 'pure subjective alienation'.»

### Where Marx and Hegel agree

«They both aim to bring society closer to situation (iv)—that is, a social world lacking systemic forms of both objective and subjective alienation»

### Where Marx and Hegel disagree

«but, since they disagree about wether we are starting from, they propose different routes to that shared goal.»

### Marx's approach

«For Marx, since we start from situation (i), this requires that the existing world be overturned; that is, that both institutions and attitudes need to be revolutionased (overcoming objective and subjective alienation).»

### Hegel's approach

«For Hegel, since we start from situation (iii), this requires only attitudinal change: we come to recognise that the existing world is already objectively 'a home', and in this way 'reconcile' ourselves to that world, overcoming pure subjective alienation in the process.»

### 'Pure Objective Alienation' in the real world

«Situation (ii) consists of a social world containing objective, but not subjective, alienation—a situation that can be characterised as one of 'pure objective alienation'»

### Marcuse's view on 'pure objective alienation'

«in the pessimistic diagnosis of Herber Marcuse (1898-1979), articulated in _One-Dimensional Man_ (1964), individuals in advanced capitalist societies appear happy in their dysfunctional relationships—they 'identify themselves' with their estranged circumstances and gain 'satisfaction' from them.»

###  'Pure Objective Alienation' without social conflict

«Objective alienation still obtains, but no longer generates social conflict, since the latter is assumed—not implausibly—to require gents who feel, or experience, some form of hostility or rebelliousness towards existing social arrangements.»

### 'Pure Objective Alienation' can disenfranchise people

«Feelings of powerlessness and isolation, for instance, might well generate social withdrawal and individual atomism, rather than radical social engagement and cooperative endeavour, on the part of the relevant agents.»

### Existentialists and 'Pure Objective Alienation'

«existentialists appear to think of (something like) objective alienation as a permanent feature of all human societies.»

### Existentialists feel alienated from the world

«Rejecting both substantive accounts of essential human nature, and the ethical embrace of social relations that facilitate the development and deployment of those human characteristics, they rather maintain that the social world will always remain 'other', can never be a 'home'.»

### Logical conclusion: the social world will never be a home for existentialists

«The preferred outcome here seems to involve individuals embodying a norm of 'authenticity', which amongst other conditions—such as choosing, or committing, to their own projects—may require that they have the 'courage' to 'grasp, accept, and, perhaps even affirm' the fact that the social world is not a home for them.»

### The need for a criteria of 'Impropriety'

«The second of the interesting complexities broached here concerns what we can call the need for a criterion of 'impropriety'—that is, a criterion by which candidate separations might be identified as problematic or not.»

### Human nature as the historical criteria of impropriety

«Historically, this role—identifying whether candidate separations are problematic—has often been played by accounts of our essential human nature. However, motivated by suspicion of that latter idea, theorists of alienation have sometimes sought alternatives to fulfill that role.»

### Naturalistic perspective

«Simply put, separations are problematic if they frustrate, and unproblematic if they facilitate, 'self-realisation'.»

### Why self-realisation is important

«Self-realisation is understood here as a central part of the good life and as consisting in the development and deployment of an individual's essential human characteristics.»

### Separation of individuals goes against nature

«For example, the separations of individuals from each other is, [...], indirectly also a separation from human nature, from the cooperation and sociability that characterises our essential humanity.»

### The need for an alternative criterion of 'impropriety'

«Given the widespread contemporary suspicion of such accounts—not least, by those opposed to what is sometimes called 'essentialism' about human nature—it might be helpful to sketch a recent account of alienation which is not dependent on such assumptions (or, at least, consciously strives to avoid them).»

### Critical Theory's view of alienation

«Alienation is still associated with the frustration of freedom, with disruptions to something like 'self-realisation'. However, this account—unlike its forerunners and associates—is said not to be fatally compromised by a commitment to either 'strongly objectivistic' theories of the life or 'essentialist' conceptions of the self.»

### Concept of Appropriation

«The crucial term of art here is 'appropriation', which Jaeggi uses to refer to the capacity for, and process of, relating to our own actions and projects in ways which engage 'something like self-determination and being the author of one's own life'.»

### When appropriation is successful

«Appropriation is successful—and alienation is absent—when 'one is present in one's actions, steers one's life instead of being driven by it, independently appropriates social roles and is able to identify with one's desires, and is involved in the world'.»

### When appropriation is unsuccessful

«In contrast, appropriation is unsuccessful—and alienation is present—when there is 'an adecquate power and a lack of presence in what one does, a failure to identify with one's own actions and desires and to take part in one's own life'»

### Alienation is the result of systematic disruptions of appropriation

«Alienation is thus identified with systematic disruptions of the process of appropriation—in particular, in those systematic disruptions which lead us to fail to experience our actions and projects as our own.»

### The four main forms of disruptions

«These disruptions are said typically to take one of four forms: first, 'powerlessness' or the experience of losing control over one's own life; second, 'loss of authenticity' specially when one is unable to identify with one's own social roles; third, 'internal division' where one experiences some of one's own desires and impulses as alien; and fourth, 'indifference' or a detachment from one's own previous projects and self-understandings.»

### The purpose of this new criterion

«the conditions for identifying the relevant dysfunctional relation here are intended to be less demanding and controversial than those involving claims about our essential human nature.»

### Immanent Critique

«this account of alienation can be presented as a form of _immanent critique_—that is, as utilising a standpoint which judges individuals and forms of life according to standards that those individuals have themselves propounded or which those forms of lie presupose.»

### Tensions between individual agency and systemic obstructions

«At the individual level, this critique might involve identifying potential tensions between the conditions of treating people as responsible agents, and the obstructions to such agency that characterise alienated selves.»

### Ideals vs concrete implementation

«And at the social level, this critique might involve identifying potential discrepancies between modern ideals of freedom and their actual realisation in the contemporary world.»

### The ethical worth of self-determination is not self-evident

«one might wonder about the ground(s) of normativity; after all, that the kind of subjectivity or self-determination which appropriation embodies is recognised and valued in modern culture does not in itself establish its ethical worth.»

### 'Systemic' problems and solutions seems to rely on the individual level

«one might be sceptical about the degree of social criticism here, since both the sources of, and solutions to, Jaeggi's paradigmatic examples of unsuccessful appropriation ('powerless', 'loss of authenticity', 'internal division', and 'indifference') seem to focus on the 'thoughts and dispositions' of individuals rather than the structures of particular societies»

### Two implicit features present in the theory of alienation

«the claim that alienation is necessarily a negative, but not a wholly negative, phenomenon, is elaborated and defended; and the suggestion that some forms of moral theory or even morality itself might encourage or embody alienation is briefly outlined.»

### Summary of alienation

«Alienation, on the present account, consists in the separation of certain entities—a subject and some object—that properly belong together. As a result, alienation always involves a loss or lack of something of value, namely, the 'proper'—rational, natural, or good—harmony or connectedness between the relevant subject and object.»

### Not so obvious: alienation is not always a negative phenomena

«It is the second part of the claim which looks less obvious: that alienation is not a wholly negative phenomena, that is, that the loss or lack here may not always be the whole story, ethically speaking.»

### Marxist narrative: Primordial Communism and separation

«In the first historical stage (of past pre-capitalist societies) there is a problematic relation, but no separation.»

### Marxist narrative: Future Communist Societies and separation

«And in the third historical stage (of future communist societies) there is a separation but it is a healthy rather than problematic.»

### Marxist narrative: Current Societies and separation

«In this second historical stage of alienation, there is a loss, or lack, of something of value; roughly speaking, it is the loss or lack of the individuals' attachment to their local role and community. (More precisely, we might say that they have lost a sense of, and connection to, the community, and that they lack a healthy sense of, and connection to, the community.)»

### Marxist narrative: We gain individuality by loosing community

«In short, the loss or lack of something of value is not the only feature of the second stage of alienation. There is also an important gain here, namely, the achievemenet of what we can call 'individuality'.»

### Wide claim

«The claim goes beyond the familiar suggestion that alienation from a necessary step in certain Hegelian and Marxist developmental narratives. The suggestion here is that internal to the second stage, the stage of alienation, there is both a problematic separation from community and a positive liberation from engulfment.»

### Missing an important thread

«Those who see only the negative thread in alienation, and fail to see 'what is being achieved within in and distorted by it', will miss an important, albeit subtle, thread in Marx's account of the progressive character of capitalism.»

### Recognising alienation is not wholly negative

«The point emphasised here is that theorists—even critics—of alienation need not to assume that it is a wholly negative phenomena, ethically speaking.»

### Even Marx recognisis the good elements of alienation

«Marx, for example, recognises that the moment of alienation, for all its negative features, also involves the emergence of a good (individuality), which, in due course (and freed from the limitations of historical origins), will be central to the human flourishing achieved in communist society.»

### Some forms of morality encourage alienation

«The broad suggestion is that morality, or certain conceptions of morality, might embody, or encourage, alienation.»

### Valuable forms of problematic separation

«More precisely, morality, or certain conceptions of morality, might embody or encourage a problematic division of self and a problematic separation much that is valuable in our lives.»

### Universalisation as a form of alienation

«Consider, for example, accounts of the moral standpoint as requiring universalisation and equal consideration of all persons (Railton 1984: 138). It could seem that adopting such a standpoint requires individuals to disown or downplay the relevance of their more personal or partial (as opposed to impartial) beliefs and feelings.»

### Marginal place for individual relations

«If these impersonal kinds of moral consideration are to dominate our practical reasoning, then it seems likely that an individual's particular attachments, loyalties, and commitments will have, at best, a marginal place.»

### Forms of morality require a separation of self and the world

«So understood, morality, or certain conceptions of morality, are charged with embodying and encouraging alienation in the form of both a divided self, and a separation of self and world.»

### The obsession over 'operationalising' alienation

«literature is often preoccupied with 'operationalising' the concept—for instance, treating job satisfaction or absenteeism as proxies of alienated work—in order to engineer predictive models in disciplines (including education, psychology, sociology, and management studies) dealing with a variety of real world contexts»

### Empirical dimensions of 'alienation'

«As an example of some of the empirical dimensions of broadly philosophical accounts of alienation, consider Marx's characterisation of capitalist society as characterised by separations which frustrate self-realisation, specially self-realisation in work.»

### Is work under capitalism indeed alienated?

«To come to a considered judgement about the plausibility of his views on this topic, one would have to be in a position to asses, amongst other issues, whether work in capitalist societies is necessarily alienation.»

### Can 'unalienated work' be possible under capitalism?

«One would need to judge not only whether existing work rightly characterised as alienated (as forced, frustrating self-realisation, not intended to satisfy the needs of others, and not appropriately appreciated by those others), but also, if so, whether it could be made meaningful and unalienated without determining the very features which made the relevant society a capitalist one.»
