## Notes

### What Alienation describes

«The concept of alienation identifies a distinct kind of psychological or social ill; namely, one involving a problematic separation between a self and other that belong together.»

### What Alienation refers to

«'Alienation', and its cognates, could variously refer: to an individual's estrangement from God (it appears thus in the Wycliffle Bible); to legal transfers of ownership rights (initially, specially in land); and to mental derangement (a historical connection that survived into the nineteenth-century usage of the term 'alienist' for a psychiatric doctor).»

### Alienation simplified

«it understands alienation as consisting in the problematic separation of a subject and object that belong together.»

### Elements of alienation

«The characterisation of alienation offered here [...] involves three constituent elements: a subject, an object, and the relation between them.»

### The subject of alienation

«the _subject_ here is a self; typically, but not necessarily, a person, an individual agent.»

### Subject as a group

«'Not necessarily' because the subject could also be, for instance, a group of some kind.»

### The Object of alienation

«the relevant _object_ can take a variety of forms. These include: entities which are not a subject; another subject or subjects; and oneself.»

### Examples of objects of alienation

«Beatrice might be alienated from the natural world, from a social practice, from an institution, or from a social norm, where none of those entities are understood as agents of any kind.»

### The relationship of alienation

«the _relation_ is one of problematic separation between a subject and object that belong together.»

### All three elements are required in order to be alienation

«All of these elements are required: there has to be a separation; the separation has to be problematic; and it has to obtain between a subject and object that properly belong together.»

### A problematic relationship is necessary, but not sufficient for there to be alienation

«The idea of _separation_ is important. Not all problematic relations between relevant entities involve alienation.»
