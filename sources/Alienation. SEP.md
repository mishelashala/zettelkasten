## Notes

### What Alienation describes

«The concept of alienation identifies a distinct kind of psychological or social ill; namely, one involving a problematic separation between a self and other that belong together.»

### What Alienation refers to

«'Alienation', and its cognates, could variously refer: to an individual's estrangement from God (it appears thus in the Wycliffle Bible); to legal transfers of ownership rights (initially, specially in land); and to mental derangement (a historical connection that survived into the nineteenth-century usage of the term 'alienist' for a psychiatric doctor).»

### Alienation simplified

«it understands alienation as consisting in the problematic separation of a subject and object that belong together.»

### Elements of alienation

«The characterisation of alienation offered here [...] involves three constituent elements: a subject, an object, and the relation between them.»

### The subject of alienation

«the _subject_ here is a self; typically, but not necessarily, a person, an individual agent.»

### Subject as a group

«'Not necessarily' because the subject could also be, for instance, a group of some kind.»

### The Object of alienation

«the relevant _object_ can take a variety of forms. These include: entities which are not a subject; another subject or subjects; and oneself.»

### Examples of objects of alienation

«Beatrice might be alienated from the natural world, from a social practice, from an institution, or from a social norm, where none of those entities are understood as agents of any kind.»

### The relationship of alienation

«the _relation_ is one of problematic separation between a subject and object that belong together.»

### All three elements are required in order to be alienation

«All of these elements are required: there has to be a separation; the separation has to be problematic; and it has to obtain between a subject and object that properly belong together.»

### A problematic relationship is necessary, but not sufficient for there to be alienation

«The idea of _separation_ is important. Not all problematic relations between relevant entities involve alienation.»

### A separation is not necessarily problematic

«Separations between a subject and object do not necessarily appear problematic. Relations of indifference, for example, might or might not be problematic.»

### Appropriately Problematic Separation

«to be appropriately problematic—appropriate, that is, to constitute examples of alienation—the separations have to obtain between a subject and object that _properly_ belong together.»

### What constitutes an appropriately problematic separation

«the candidate separations have to frustrate or conflict with the proper harmony or connectedness between that subject and object.»

### What constitutes a harmonious relation

«To say that they properly belong together is to suggest that the harmonious or connected relation between the subject and object is rational, natural, or good.»

### What constitutes a conflicting relation

«And, in turn, that the separations frustrating or conflicting with that baseline condition, are correspondingly irrational, unnatural, or bad.»

### The need for establishing a harmonic baseline

«that is not yet to identify what might establish this baseline harmony as, say, rational, natural, or good.»

### Implication: Entities without almost nothing in common

«This basic idea of alienation appears to give us a diverse but distinct set of social and psychological phenomena; picking out a class of entities which might have little in common other than this problematic separation of subject and object.»

### Alienation: A diagnosis without treatment

«the problematic separations might indicate that something is awry with the self or social world, but do not, in themselves, offer an explation of, or suggest a solution to, those ills.»

### The "modesty" of the concept of alienation

«On this account, the basic idea of alienation looks conceptually rather modest.»

### There's no relation between different sources of alienation

«Nor, for instance, need there be any suggestion that the various forms of alienation identified by this account are necessarily related to each other; that, for example, they are all explained by the same underlying factor.»

### Prevalence of alienation in liberal societies

«alienation picks out an array of non-trivial social and psychological ills that are prevalent in modern liberal societies»

### Alienation is different from injustice

«the idea of 'alienation' is distinct from that of 'injustice' on which much modern liberal political philosophy is focused.»

### Implication: there's something deeply wrong with liberal societies

«The implied critical suggestion—that the concept of alienation reveals that something significant is awry with both liberal society and liberal understandings—looks far from trivial.»

### Conflating alienation with fetishism and objetification

«particular accounts of alienation both within and beyond those two traditions, are sometimes said—more or less plausibly—to conflate alienation either with fetishism, or with objectification.»

### Alienation is not fetishism nor objetification

«Even if some particular treatments of alienation do equate the relevant concepts with each other, alienation is better understood as synonymous with neither fetishism nor objectification.»

### They overlap, but they are not synonymous

«Rather, fetishism is only one form that alienation can take, and not all objectification involves alienation.»

### Definition of Fetishism

«'Fetishism' refers here to the idea of human creations which have somehow escaped (we might say that they have inappropriately separated out from) human control, achieved the appearance of independence, and come to enslave or dominate their creators.»

### Fetishism as a feature of modernity

«Marx sometimes treats the phenomenon of fetishism as a distinguishing feature of modernity; where previous historical epochs were characterised by the rule of persons over persons, capitalist society is characterised by the rule of things over persons.»

### The Fetishism of 'Market forces'

«Consider, for instance, the frequency with which 'market forces' are understood and represented within modern culture as something outside of human control, as akin to natural forces which decide our fate.»

### The Fetishism of Religious Consciousness

«The famous, and disarmingly simple, conclusion of Feuerbach's philosophical analysis of religious consciousness is that, in Christianity, individuals are worshipping the predicates of human nature, freed of their individual limitations and project onto an ideal entity. For Feuerbach, however, this is no purely intellectual error, but is rather ripe with social, political, and psychological consequences, as this 'deity' now comes to enslave and dominate us.»

### Religious Consciousness, alienation, and fetishism

«Religious consciousness, on this Feuerbachian account, looks to be a case where alienation takes the form of fetishism. That is, there is both a problematic separation here between subject and object (individuals and their own human nature), and it takes the form of human creation (the idea of species embodied in God) escaping our control, achieving the appearance of independence, and coming to enslave and dominate us.»

### The 'Fetishism' of Capital

«Capital takes on the appearance of an independent social power which determines what is produced, how it is produced, and the economic (and other) relations between producers.»

### Fetishism is a form of alienation

«rather than equating alienation and fetishism, fetishism is better thought of as a particular form that alienation might take.»

### Marxist theory of 'alienated' relation with the natural world

«Consider, for instance, the problematic separation sometimes said to exist between modern individuals and the natural world, as the former think of themselves and behave as if they were isolated, or cut off, or estranged, from the latter.»

### Marxist theory of 'Unalienated' relation with the natural world and others

«the appropriate relation between humankind and nature would involve not our instrumental domination of 'the other', but rather a sympathetic appreciation of our complex interdependence with the natural world of which we are, in reality, a part.»

### Alienation from the natural world, but not fetishism

«The inappropriate modern relation between humankind and nature here looks like an example of alienation—there is a problematic separation of self and other—but certain central characteristics of fetishism would appear to be absent.»

### No obvious domination relation

«Moreover, the impact of humankind of this particular separation does not comfortably suit the language of enslavement and domination.»

### We instrumentalize nature, instead of nature having tyranny over us

«Indeed, if anything, our inappropriate separation from the natural world seems to find expression in our own ruthlessly instrumental treatment of nature, rather than in nature's tyranny over us.»

### We objectify the natural world

«In the present context, objectification refers rather to the role of productive activity in mediating the evolving relationship between humankind and the natural world.»

### Our relation with nature

«humans beings confront the natural world from an original position of scarcity, struggling through productive activity of various kinds to change the material form of nature—typically through making things—in ways that make it better reflect and satisfy their own needs and interests.»

### We have a mutually transformative relation with nature

«In that evolving process, both the natural world and humankind come to be transformed.»

### Productive activity implies objectification

«On this account, all productive activity would seem to involve objectification.»

### To Marx not all productive activities take an alienated form

«Marx maintains that productive activity might or might not take an alienated form.»

### Productive work is 'unalienated' in communist societies

«For instance, productive activity in capitalists societies is typically said to take an alienated form; where as productive activity in communist societies is typically predicated to take an unalienated or meaningful form.»

### How alienated work looks like

«Schematically, we might portray alienated labour (characteristic of capitalist society) as: bein forced; not involving self-realisation (not developing and deploying essential human powers); not intended to satisfy the needs of others; and not appropriately appreciated by those others.»

### How 'unalienated' work looks like

«And, schematically, we might portray unalienated or meaningful work (characteristic of communist society) as: being freely chosen; involving self-realisation (the development and deployment of essential human powers); being intended to satisfy the needs of others; and being appropriately appreciated by those others.»

### Work as a 'necessary evil'

«work is seen as a necessary evil, an unpleasant activity unfortunately required for our survival.»

### Christian view: all work takes an alienated form

«It owes its name to Christianity's embrace of the claim that alienated work is part of the human condition: at leas since the Fall, human beings are required to work by the sweat of their brows.»

### The Christian view confuses alienation with objectification

«On Marx's account, or something like it, one might characterise this Christian view as mistakenly equating objectification and alienation, confusing productive activity as such with its stunted and inhuman forms.»

### What this socially alienated confusion tell us about Christianity

«this kind of confusion reflects the alienated social condition of humankind, embodying an emblematic failure to understand that material production is a central realm in which human beings can express, in free and creative ways, the kind of creatures that they are.»

### Some forms of alienation have nothing to do with productive activities

«according to the basic idea defended here, equating alienation and objectification fails to appreciate that certain forms of alienation might have nothing at all to do with productive activity.»

### Fetishism and objectification are not synonymous of alienation

«neither fetishism, nor objectification, are best construed as identical with alienation. Rather than being synonymous, these concepts only partially overlap.»

### How to understand fetishism

«Fetishism can be understood as picking out only a subset—on some accounts perhaps a large subset–of cases of alienation.»

### Objectification without alienation

«And there are forms of objectification which do not involve alienation—outside of productive activity—with no obvious connection to objectification.»
