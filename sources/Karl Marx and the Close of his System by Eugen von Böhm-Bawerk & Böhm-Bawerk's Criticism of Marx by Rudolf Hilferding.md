## Notes from "Karl Marx and the Close of his System"

### Premise of the author

«the Marxian teaching was charged from top to bottom with every kind of contraction both of logic and of fact.», p3

### Confronting a model with reality

«General principles can be very prettily put forward in the "general Sections" of a book, but whether they really possess the convincing power ascribe to them by their author can only be ascertained when in the construction of the system they are brought face to face with all the facts in detail.», p4

### [x] What determines the value of commodities

«Max had taught in his first volume that the whole value of commodities was based on the labor embodied in them», p4

### [x] The "law of value"

«and that by virtue of this "law of value" they must exchange in proportion to the quantity of labor which they contain», p4

### [x] Where does profit comes from

«that, further, the profit or surplus value falling to the capitalist was the fruit of extortion practiced on the worker», p4

### [x] Surplus "doesn't come" from constant capital

«the amount of surplus value was not in proportion to the whole amount of the capital employed by the capitalist», p4

### [x] Surplus "comes" from variable capital

«but only to the amount of the "variable" part—that is, to that part of capital paid in wages», p4

### [x] Constant capital "adds no surplus value"

«while the "constant capital," the capital employed in the purchase of the means of production added no surplus value.», p4

### Claim: profit comes from the total sum of invested capital

«In daily life, however, the profit of capital is in proportion to the _total_ capital invested», p4

### Claim: the amount of work doesn't determine the exchange price

«the commodities do not as a fact exchange in proportion to the amount of work incorporated in them.», p4

### Claim: Marx knew about the contradiction with reality

«"This law" (the law, namely, that surplus value is in proportion only to the variable part of capital), "clearly contradicts all prima facie experience."», p4-5

> Note: they are quoting "Capital, Vol. I", p335

### Marx was gonna come up with a solution to the contradiction in later volumes of the Capital

«But at the same time he declares the contradiction to be only a seeming one, the solution of which requires many missing links, and will be postponed to later volumes of his work.», p5

### It's about fate man

«His simple promise outweighed all logical refutations.», p5

### Marx left a "solution"

«But the preface of the editor, Friedrich Engels, not only contained the reiterated positive assertion that the solution was given in the manuscript left by Marx.», p5

### [x] Marx's dishonest definition of commodities

«he limits from the beginning to _commodities_, by which, according to him, we are not to understand all economic goods, but only those _products of labor_ which are made for the market.», p9

### [x] Definition of commodity

«A commodity is, on one side, a useful thing, which by its properties satisfies human wants of some kind; and on the other, it forms the material medium of exchange value.», p9

### [x] Definition of Exchange Value

«"Exchange value presents itself in the first instance as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which values in use of one kind are exchanged for values in use of another kind, a relation which constantly changes with time and place."», p9-10

> Note: Author is quoting Capital Vol. I

### [x] Implication of Exchange Value

«Exchange value, therefore, appears to be something accidental. And yet there must be in this changing relation something that is stable and unchanging», p10

### [x] What do commodities have in common?

«"[...] there exists a common factor of the same magnitude in two different things, in a quarter of wheat and in cwt. of iron. The two things are therefore equal to a third which is in itself neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, so far as it is an exchange value, must therefore be reducible to that third."», p10

### [x] The common factor "is not a physical property"

«"This common factor," Marx goes on, "cannot be a geometrical, physical, chemical or other natural property of the commodities.», p10

### [x] Physical properties determine values of use

«Their physical properties come into consideration for the most part only in so far as they make the commodities useful, and so make them values in use.», p10

### [x] Values of use "don't determine" exchange relation

«But, on the other hand, the exchange relation of commodities is obviously determined without reference to their values in use.», p10

### [x] Values in use and exchange values are mutually exclusive

«As values in use commodities are above everything of different qualities; as exchange values they can only be of different quantities, and they can, therefore, contain no atom of value in use.», p10

### [x] Common factor by elimination: being products of labor

«If then we abstract from the value in use of commodities, there remains to them only one common property, that of being products of labor.», p10

### [x] First implication of abstracting the value in use: no more physical properties

«For if we abstract from the value in use of a commodity, we at the same time abstract from the material constituents and forms which give it a value in use. It is no longer a table, or a house, or yarn, or any other useful thing. All its physical qualities have disappeared.», p11

### [x] Second implication of abstracting the value in use: no more labor embodied in them

«Nor is it any longer the product of the labor or the carpenter, or the mason, or the spinner, or of any other particular productive industry. With the useful character of the labor products there disappears the useful character of the labors embodied in them, and there vanish also the different concrete forms of these labors.», p11

### [x] Result: abstract human labor

«They are no longer distinguished from each other, but are all reduced to identical human labor—abstract human labor.», p11

### [x] Implication: value "is not the same with" exchange value

«It is in dialectical form not identical with exchange value», p11

### [x] Marxian value: logical distilled form of value

«It is a kind of logical distillation from it.», p11

### [x] Exchange value: manifestation of the value of commodities

«"the exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed"», p11

> Note: they are quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p45

### [x] Value is measured by duration of labor

«As labor is the substance of value so the amount of the value of all goods is measured by the quantity of labor contained in them, which is, in its turn, measured by its duration», p11

### [x] Value is measured by socially necessary labor time

«but not by that particular duration, or working time, which the individual who made the commodity has happened to need, but by the working time that is socially necessary.», p11-12

### [x] Definition of "socially necessary labor time"

«Marx defines this last as the "working time required to produce a value in use under the normal conditions of production, and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society"»

> Note: they are quoting Capital, Vol. I, p46

### [x] Only socially necessary labor determines value

«"It is only the quantity of socially necessary labor, or the working time socially necessary for the production of a value in use, which determines the amount of the value."»

### [x] Single commodity vs class of commodity

«The single commodity is here to be regarded as an average specimen of its class.», p12

### [x] Same labor means same value

«Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labor are embodied, or which can be produced in the same working time, have the same value.», p12

### [x] The "law of value"

«It states, and must state, after what has gone before, that commodities are exchanged in proportion to the socially necessary working time incorporated in them.», p12

### Different expression of the "law of value"

«Other modes of expressing the same law are "commodities exchange according to their values" [...], or that "equivalent exchanges with equivalent"», p12

> Note: they are quoting Capital, Vol. I, p177, p184, p217; Capital Vol. III, p221

### [x] Fluctuations in prices "cancel each other over time"

«these "constant oscillations of market prices . . . compensate and cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average price as their inner law"», p12

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p184n

### [x] The "law of value" imposes itself over time

«"In the long run "the socially necessary working time always asserts itself by main force, like an overruling natural law, in the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations"», p12

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p86

### [x] The "law of value" as an "eternal law"

«Marx declares this law to be the "eternal law of the exchange of commodities", [...], and "the rational element" and "the natural law of equilibrium"», p12-13

> Note: author is quoting from Capital Vol. I, p215; Capital, Vol. III, p221

### [x] The doctrine of surplus values is derived from the theory of value

«On these principles of the theory of value Marx founds the second part of the structure of his teaching, his renowned doctrine of surplus value.», p13

### [x] Doctrine of surplus value: where does profit come from?

«In this part he traces the source of the gain which capitalists obtain from their capital.», p13

### [x] How capitalists operate

«Capitalists lay down a certain sum of money, convert it into commodities, and then—with or without an intermediate process of production—convert these back again into more money.», p13

### [x] Profit "doesn't come" from buying under value or selling over value

«He first declares that the surplus value cannot originate either in the fact that the capitalist, as a buyer, buys commodities regularly under their value, nor in the fact that the capitalist, as a seller, sells them over their value.», p13

### [x] Solution: labor power

«The solution Marx finds in this, that there is one commodity whose value in use possesses that peculiar property of being a source of exchange value. This commodity is the capacity of labor, labor power.», p13-14

### [x] Laborers sell themselves as slaves in the market

«It is offered for sale in the market under the twofold condition that the laborer is personally free, for otherwise it would not be his labor power only that would be for sale, but his whole person as a slave», p14

### [x] Laborers have to sell their labor power because they don't own the means of production

«and that the laborer is destitute of "all the means necessary for the realizing of his labor power"», p14

### [x] Otherwise they would not need the capitalist

«for otherwise he would prefer to produce on his own account and to offer for sale his products rather than his labor power.», p14

### [x] Capitalists obtain surplus value from trading labor power

«It is by trading in this commodity that the capitalist obtains the surplus value», p14

### [x] How "it works"

«and he does in the following way: the value of the commodity, "labor power," is regulated like any other commodity by the working time necessary for its reproduction», p14

### [x] Only paying what is minimally necessary for the subsistence of the worker

«by the working time which is needed to create so much means of subsistence as is required for the maintenance of the worker.», p14

### Paying the laborer "what his work is worth" would lead to no surplus

«But if he [the capitalist] made him [the laborer] work only so many hours a day as are embodied in the labor power itself, and as must have been paid for in the buying of the same, no surplus value would arise.», p14

> Note: clarification added by me

### [x] Working more hours than the hours they are getting payed

«But this is not the way in which capitalists act. Even if they have bought the labor power for a price which only corresponds to six hour's working time, they yet make the laborer work the whole day for them.», p14

### [x] Capitalists pay less than what they receive back

«And now in the product made during this day there are incorporated more hours of labor than the capitalist was obligated to pay for.», p14

### The difference in hours worked and wages is the "surplus value"

«He has, therefore, a greater value than the wages he has paid, and the difference is "surplus value," which falls to the capitalists.», p14

### [x] Surplus is the result of unpaid working hours

«Surplus value, therefore, according to Marx, is due to the fact that the capitalist makes the laborer work for him a part of the day without paying him for it.», p15

### [x] The "necessary working time" covers the cost of living of the worker

«In the first part—the "necessary working time"—the worker produces the means necessary for his own support, or the value for those means; and for this part of his labor he receives an equivalent in wages.», p16

### [x] The capitalist appropriates the "surplus working time"

«During the second part—the "surplus working time"—he is exploited, he produces "surplus value" without receiving any equivalent for it.», p16

### [x] Conclusion: surplus value comes from unpaid work to the worker

«"All surplus value is in substance the embodiment of unpaid working time"», p16

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p585

### [x] For Marx surplus always comes from "living work"

«new surplus value can only be created by the living work which the capitalist gets the worker to perform.», p16

### [x] For Marx surplus never comes from the "means of production"

«The value of the means of production which are used is maintained, and it reappears in a different form in the value of the product, but adds no surplus value.», p16

### [x] Capital converted to constant capital never produces value

«That part of the capital, therefore, which is converted into the means of production, that is, into raw material, auxiliary material, and implements of labor, does not alter the amount of its value in the process of production"», p16

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p233

### [x] Rate of surplus value

«the proportion in which the surplus value stands to the advanced variable part of capital (in which alone the surplus value "makes good its value") Marx calls the _rate of surplus value_.», p16

### [x] Rate of surplus value as an expression of degree of exploitation

«It is identical with the proportion in which the surplus working time stands to the necessary working time, or the unpaid labor to the paid, and serves Marx, therefore, as an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor.», p16-17

### [x] Rate of surplus value and rate of profit are different

«Totally different from this is the rate of profit.», p17

### [x] How rate of profit is calculated

«The capitalist calculates the surplus value, which he appropriates, not only upon the variable capital but upon the total amount of capital employed.», p17

### [x] Logical conclusion: greater variable capital implies higher rate of profiter

«the greater the variable and the less the constant capital employed [...] the higher will be the rate of profit.», p17

### [x] Marxian Claim about the organic composition of capital

«The "organic composition" [...] of the capital is for technical reasons necessarily different in the different "spheres of production."», p19

### [x] Pre-supposition: equal rate of surplus value equals different rates of profits

«According to the preceding argument [...] given an equal rate of surplus value, every branch of production must show a different, a special rate of profit, on the condition certainly, which Marx has hitherto always assumed, that commodities exchange with each other "according to their values," or in proportion to the work embodied in them.», p19-20

### [x] Marxian pre-supposition

«His theory demands that capitals of equal amount, but of dissimilar organic composition, should exhibit different profits.», p20

### [x] The real world "shows the contrary"

«The real world, however, most plainly shows that it is governed by the law that capitals of equal amount, without regard to possible differences of organic composition, yield equal profits.», p20

### [x] General tendency of capital

«there is a law (or general tendency), _although only for capitals possessing the same organic composition_—the same periods of turnover being assumed—that the profits are in proportion to the amounts of the capitals, and therefore equal amounts of capital yield in equal periods of time equal amounts of profit.», p20

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### [x] The argument rests on the "law of value"

«The argument rests on the basis which has hitherto generally been the basis of our reasoning, _that commodities are sold according to their values_.», p20

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### [x] The average rate does not exist

«the difference in the average rate of profit for different branches of industry _does not exist_ and could not exist without upsetting the whole system of capitalist production.», p20

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### [x] Marxian claim: The law of value is incompatible with reality

«_It appears therefore that here the theory of values is irreconcilable with the actual movement of things_, irreconcilable with the actual phenomena of production, and that, on this account, the attempt to understand the latter must be given up.»

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### [x] Marx has to get rid of the "law of value"

«To speak plainly his solution is obtained at the cost of the assumption from which Marx has hitherto started, _that commodities exchange according to their values_. This assumption Marx now simply drops.», p21

### Marx solution to different rates of surplus with different organic composition: competition

«Marx goes on to say that all this is not a mere hypothetical assumption, but absolute fact. The operating agent is _competition_.», p23

### [x] Conclusion: composition is originally different

«It is true that owing to the different organic composition of the capitals invested in various branches of production "the rates of profit which obtain in these different branches _are originally very different_"», p23

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### [x] Premise: competition brings down the rates of profit

«But "these different rates of profit are reduced by competition to a common rate which is the average of all these different rates"», p23

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### [x] Average Profit

«The profit corresponding to this common rate, which falls to a given amount of capital, whatever its organic composition may be, is called _average profit._», p23-24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### [x] Price of Production

«That price of a commodity which is equal to its cost price plus its share of the yearly average profit of the capital employed (not merely that consumed) in its production (regard being had to the quickness or slowness of turnover) is its _price of production_», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### [x] Exchange relation is determined by the price of production

«And the actual exchange relation of the separate commodities is _no longer determined by their values but by their prices of production_», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p231

### [x] Value and price of production coincide accidentally

«Value and price of production are only exceptionally and accidentally coincident, namely, in those commodities which are produced by the aid of a capital, the organic composition of which chances to coincide exactly with the _average_ composition of the whole social capital.», p24

### [x] Capitals of Higher Composition

«According to Marx we call "capitals which contain greater percentage of constant, and therefore a smaller percentage of variable capital than the social average capital, capitals of _higher_ composition"», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p193

### [x] Capitals of Lower Composition

«"and contrariwise those capitals in which the constant capital fills a relatively smaller, and the variable a relatively larger space than in the social average capital are called capitals of _lower_ composition"», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p193

### Higher composition leads to above value commodities

«in all those commodities which have been created by the aid of capital of "higher" composition than the average composition the price of production will be _above_ their value», p24

### [x] Lower composition leads to under value commodities

«and in the opposite case it will be _under_ the value.», p24

### Average Profit formula

«the average profit is nothing else "than the total amount of surplus value divided among the amounts of capital in every sphere of production in proportion to their quantities"», p25

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p205

### The question of the adjustment to a common rate of profits

«Marx, in conclusion, puts and answers one more question, which he regards as the specially difficult question: in what manner "does this adjustment of profits to a common rate of profit take place, since it is evidently a result and not a starting point?», p25

### Answer: In pre-capitalists societies that "doesn't happen"

«He first of all puts forward the view that in a condition of society in which the capitalist system is not yet dominant, and in which, therefore, the laborers themselves are in possession of the necessary means of production, commodities are actually exchanged according to their real value, and the rates of profit could _not_ therefore be equalized.», p25-26

### Marx treats it as a "historical fact"

«Marx thinks he is entitled to assert that it is "quite in accordance with facts to regard the values of commodities as, not only theoretically but also historically, prior to the prices of production"», p26

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p209

### The adjustment of rates do take place in capitalist societies

«In societies organized on the capitalist system, however, this changing of values into prices of production and the equalization of the rates of profit which follows certainly do take place.», p26

### Marxian explanation of the adjustments of rates

«"If commodities are . . . sold according to their values . . . very different rates of profit are obtained. . . . Capital withdraws itself, however, from a sphere with a low rate of profit, and throws itself into another which yields a higher profit. By this continual interchange, or, in a word, by its apportionment between the different spheres, as the rate of profit sinks here and rises there, such a relation of supply to demand is created as to make the average profit in the different spheres of production th same, and thus values are changed into prices of production"», p26-27

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p230

### Eugene vom Böm-Bawerk's critic

«"Either products do actually exchange in the long run in proportion to the labor attaching to them—in which case an equalization of the gains of capital is impossible; or there is an equalization of the gains of capital—in which case it is impossible that products should continue to exchange in proportion to the labor attaching them"», p28

> Note: quoting from "Capital and Interest", p362

### Marx responses to the critique

«And he even goes so far as to say, with the same directness and clearness, that the several commodities do not actually exchange with each other in proportion to the labor they contain, but that they exchange in that varying proportion to the labor which is rendered necessary by the equalization of the gains of capital.», p29

### Eugene von Böm-Bawerk's questioning of the response

«does it not prove that the equal average rate of profit can only manifest itself if, and because, the alleged law of value does not hold good?», p29

### Reiterating the Labor Value Theory

«In the first volume it was maintained, with great emphasis, that all value is based on labor and labor alone, and that values of commodities were in proportion to the working time necessary for their production.», p29

### Reiterating labor as the common exchange factor

«The value was declared to be "the common factor which appears in the exchange relation of commodities"», p29

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p45

### Rare exceptions in the "law of value"

«Apart, therefore, from temporary and occasional variations which "appear to be a breach of the law of the exchange of commodities" [...], commodities which embody the same amount of labor _must_ on principle, in the long run, exchange for each other.», p30

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p177

### Contradiction in the volume 3 of the Capital

«And now in the third volume we are told briefly and dryly that what, according to the teaching of the first volume, _must_ be, is not and never can be; that individual commodities do and must exchange with each other in a proportion different from that of the labor incorporated in them, and this not accidentally and temporarily, but out necessity and permanently.», p30

### Marx's defense of the contradiction

«Marx does not omit to interpolate in numerous places the express declaration that, in spite of exchange relations being directly governed by prices of production, which differ from the values, all is nevertheless moving within the lines of the law of value and this law, "in the last resort" at least, governs prices.», p31

### Marx's first argument for his defense

«event if the _separate_ commodities are being sold above or below their values, these reciprocal fluctuations cancel each other, and in the community itself—taking into account all the branches of production—the _total of the prices of production_ of the commodities produced still remains _equal to the sum of their values_», p32

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p188

### Marx's second argument of his defense

«the law of value governs the _movement of prices_, since the diminution or increase of the requisite working time makes the prices of production rise or fall»

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p208, p211

### Marx's third argument of his defense

«the law of value, Marx affirms, governs with undiminished authority the exchange of commodities in _certain "primary" stages_, in which the change of values into prices of production has not yet been accomplished.», p32

### Marx's fourth argument of his defense

«in a complicated economic system the law of value regulates prices of production at least _indirectly and in the last resort_, since the total value of the commodities, determined by the law of value, determines the total surplus value. The latter, however, regulates the amount of the average profit, and therefore the general rate of profit.», p32

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p212

### The composition of the capital affects exchange relation

«It is admitted by Marx that separate commodities exchange with each other either over or under their value accordingly as the share of constant capital employed in their production is above or below average.», p32-33

### Deviations "cancel each other"

«"In the same proportion in which one part of the commodities is sold above its value another part will be sold under its value"», p33

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. III, p185

### Marx's argument

«Meanwhile it resolves itself into this—that by as much as there is too much surplus value in one commodity there is too little in another, and therefore the _deviations from value_ which lurk in the prices of production _reciprocally cancel each other_ In capitalist production as a whole _'the general law maintains itself as the governing tendency,'_ only in a very complex and approximate manner, as the constantly changing average of perpetual fluctuations.»

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. III, p190

### Schmidt also arrived at the same conclusion thru a different method

«Schmidt also, while he employed a different line of argument from Marx, arrived at the same conclusion that separate commodities _cannot_ exchange with each other in proportion to the labor attaching to them.», p33-34

### Schmidt also questioned the validity of the law of value

«He too was obligated to ask the question whether, in face of this fact, the validity of Marx's law of value could any longer be maintained, and he supported his affirmative opinion on the very argument that has just been given.», p34

### Schmidt's solution

«Every commodity which comes into exchange is at one and the same time a commodity and the price of what is given in exchange for it. The aggregate of commodities therefore is identical with the aggregate of the prices paid for them; or, the price of the whole national produce is nothing else than the national produce itself.», p35

> Note: author is quoting Conrad Schmidt

### Schmidt's own admission of saying "nothing"

«"[...] this tautological declaration denotes no increase of true knowledge, neither does it serve as a special test of the correctness of the alleged law that commodities exchange in proportion to the labor embodied in them."», p35

> Note: author is quoting Conrad Schmidt

### Marxian confusion

«Here Marx confounds two very different things: an _average of fluctuations,_ and an _average permanently and fundamentally unequal quantities_.», p37

### Böhm-Bawerk's explanation to the phenomena

«In the case of prices of production which deviate from the "values," it is not a question of fluctuations, but of necessary and permanent divergences.», p37

### Same labor but different composition don't yield same average price

«Two commodities, A and B, which contain the same amount of labor, but have been produced by capitals of different organic composition, do not fluctuate round the same average point, say, for example, the average of fifty shillings; but each of them assumes permanently a different level of price», p37

### Averages yield no meaning

«When, however, of two commodities in which the same amount of labor is incorporated, one permanently and regularly maintains a price of forty shillings and the other as permanently  and regularly the price of sixty shillings, a mathematician may indeed strike an average of fifty shillings between the two; but such an average has an entirely different meaning, or, to be more accurate, has no meaning at all with regard to our law.», p38

### Averages refute, not confirm the "law of value"

«it is evident that necessary and permanent differences of prices in commodities of the same cost in labor, but of unequal composition as regards capital, cannot by such playing with "average" and "deviations that cancel each other" be turned into a confirmation of the alleged law of value instead of a refutation.», p38

### Paraphrasing of the second argument of Marx's defense

«Marx claims for the law of value that it "governs the movement of prices," and he considers that this is proved by the fact that where the working time necessary for the production of the commodities decreases, there also prices fall; and that where it increases prices also rise, other circumstances remain equal.»

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p208

### Labor is one of many factors determining prices

«in the case of "other circumstances remaining equal" prices rise and fall according to the amount of labor expended proves clearly neither more nor less than that labor is one factor in determining prices.», p39

### For Marx labor is the only factor determining exchange relations

«by his law of value Marx had asserted much more. He had asserted that, barring occasional and momentary fluctuations of demand and supply, the labor expended was the sole factor which governed the exchange relations of commodities.», p39

### Extreme conditions for the "law of value" to be true

«Evidently it could only be maintained that _this_ law governs the movement of prices if a permanent alteration in prices could not be produced or promoted by any other cause than the alteration in the amount of working time.», p39

### Marx own doctrine contradicts itself

«an alteration in prices must occur when, for instance, the expenditure of labor remains the same, but when, owing to such circumstances as the shortening of the processes of production, the organic composition of the capital is changed.», p39

> Note: the author is paraphrasing Marx

### Contrary proposition

«prices rise or fall when, other conditions remain equal, the length of time during which the capital is invested increases or decreases.», p39-40

### Final blow to the second argument of Marx's defense

«If it is impossible to prove by the latter proposition that the length of time during which the capital is invested is the sole factor that governs exchange relations, it is equally impossible to regard the fact that alterations in the amounts of the labor expended affect the movements of prices as a confirmation of the alleged law that labor alone governs the exchange relations.», p40

### Paraphrasing third argument of Marx's defenses

«Marx affirms, and must affirm, that "the rates of profits are originally very different" [...], and that their adjustment to a general rate of profits is primarily "a result, and cannot be a starting point"», p40

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. III, p186; Capital, Vol. III, p205

### Implicit claim: specific conditions in which the law of value reigns

«This thesis further contains the claim that there exist certain "primitive" conditions in which the change of values into prices of production which leads to the adjustment of the rates of profits has not yet taken place, and which therefore are still under the complete and literal dominion of the law of value. A certain region is consequently claimed for this law in which its authority is perfectly absolute.»

### The two conditions necessary for the adjustment of the rates of profit

«According to Marx the adjustment of the rate of profit is dependent on two assumptions: first, on a capitalist system of production being in operation [...]; and secondly, on the leveling influence of _competition_ being in _effective action_», p40-41

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p206; Capital, Vol. III, p187, p204, p212, p230, p231

### First condition for the law of value to hold true: a pre-capitalist society

«By a very detailed account of the processes which obtain in a condition of society where capitalist production does not yet prevail, but "where the means of production belong to the worker," he shows the prices of commodities in this stage to be exclusively determined by their values.», p41

### Marx is treating the premise as the conclusion

«the hypothetical part describes very consistently how exchange would present itself in those primitive conditions of society _if_ everything took place according to the Marxian law of value; but that this description contains no shadow of proof, or even of an attempt at proof, _that_ under the given assumptions things must so take place. Marx relates, "supposes," asserts, but he gives no word of proof.», p43

### The consequent doesn't follow from the premise

«He consequently makes a bold, not to say naïve jump, when he proclaims as an ascertained result (as though he had successfully worked out a line of argument) that it is, _therefore_, quite consistent with facts to regard values, historically also, as prior to prices of production.», p43

### Marx didn't prove his supposition

«As a matter of fact it is beyond question that Marx has not proved by his "supposition" the historical existence of such a condition.», p43

### Backward thinking

«He has only hypothetically deduced it from his theory; and as to the credibility of that hypothesis we must, of course, be free to form our own judgment.», p43

### The problem of unequal rates of profit

«He asserts this in the form (which is also correct) that the "surplus value" which the laborers in both branches of production obtain over and aobve their necessary maintenance, calculated on the means of production advanced, shows _unequal rates of profit_.», p46

### The obvious question about the unequal rates of profit

«why should not this inequality be made to disappear by competition just as in "capitalist" society?», p46

### Marx's answer

«The essential point (he says) is that both laborers should receive the same surplus value for the same working time; or, to be more exact, that for the _same working time_ "they should receive the _same values_ after deducting the value of the advanced constant element," and on this assumption the difference in the rates of profit would be a "matter of indifference, just as it is a matter of indifference to the wage earner by what rate of profit the quantity of surplus value squeezed out of him is represented."», p46

### Böhm-Bawerk's grounds for rejection of the answer

«If I do not get a thing, then it may certainly be a matter of indifference to me whether that thing, whic I do not get, estimated on the capital of another person, represents a higher or lower percentage. But when I get a thing as a settled right, as the worker, on the non-capitalistic hypothesis, is supposed to get the surplus value as profit, then it certainly is not a matter of indifference to me by what scale that profit is to be measured or distributed.», p46

### For Böhm-Bawerk the answer doesn't make sense

«when, therefore, the somewhat improbable fact is affirmed that unequal rates of profit can exist permanently side by side without being equalized by competition, the reason for this certainly cannot be found in the assumption that the height of rate of profit is a matter of no importance whatever to the persons interested in it.», p47

### Marx saying it's a matter of indifference is not realistic

«To what worker today would it be a matter of indifference whether he received his weekly wages on Saturday evening, or a year, or three years hence?», p47

### Marxian Hypothesis limited correspondence with reality

«Still, however, conditions and relationships are found in the "modern world" which correspond at least approximately to those assumed in the Marxian hypothesis. They are found, as Marx himself specially indicates [...], in the case of the peasant propietor, who himself cultivates his own land, and in the case of the artisan.», p47

> Note: author is referencing Capital, Vol. III, p209

### Marxian Hyphotesis: In the case of peasants proprietor constant capital makes no difference in surplus value and wages

«According to the Marxian hypothesis, it ought to be a matter of observation that the incomes of these persons do not in the least depend on the amounts of capital they employed in production. They should each receive the same amount of wages and surplus value, whether the capital representing their means of production was 10 shillings or 10,000 shillings.», p47-48

### Real world experience indicates that the bigger the constant capital, the bigger the income

«the prevailing impression does not confirm Marx's hypothesis, but tends, on the contrary, to the view that in general and as a whole an ampler income is yielded by those branches of industry in which work is carried on with a considerable capital, than by those which have at their disposal only the hands of the producers.», p48

### Contrary to what Marx claims the law of value is nowhere to be found

«according to the Marxian theory, the law of value ought to be seen to be completely dominant, no trace of the process alleged by Marx is to be found.», p48

### How rates of profit should behave before the equalization

«there must be traces of the actual fact that _before_ the equalization of the rates of profit the branches of production with the relatively greater amounts of constant capital have won and do win the smallest rates of profit, while those branches with the smaller amounts of constant capital win the largest rates of profit.», p49

### No historical evidence of equalization of rates of profit

«As a matter of fact, however, there are no traces of this to be found anywhere, either in the historical past or in the present.», p49

### Böhm-Bawerk's final blow the the third argument of Marx's defense

«the law of value, which, it is conceded, must give up its alleged control over prices of production in an economy where competition is in full force, has never exercised and could never exercise a real sway even in primitive conditions.», p51

### Summary of the refutation of the first three arguments of Marx's defense

«The application of the law of value to the sum total of all commodities and prices of commodities instead of their several exchange relations (first argument) has been proved to be pure nonsense. The movement of prices (second argument) does not really obey the alleged law of value, and just as little does it exercise a real influence in "primitive conditions" (third argument).», p51

### Fourth argument in Marx's defense

«the "prices of production," which govern the actual formation of prices, are for their part in their turn under the influence of the law of value, which therefore, through the prices of production, governs the actual exchange relation. The values are "behind the prices of production and determine them in the last resort"», p51-52

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. III, p244

### What is a price of production according to Marx

«The prices of production are, as Marx often expresses it, only "changed values" or "changed forms of value"», p52

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. III, p193, p199, p204

### Marx's argument: the law of value determines the prices of production

«"_The average rate of profit which determines the price of production must_, however, always be approximately equal to the amount of _surplus value_ which falls to a given capital as an aliquot part of the total social capital . . . Now, as the total value of the commodities governs the total surplus value, and this again determines the amount of the average profit and consequently the general rate of profit—as a general law or a law governing fluctuation—the _law of value regulates the prices of production_."», p52

### The average rate of profit only determines the prices of production partially

«Marx says at the outset that the average rate of profit determines the prices of production. In Marx's sense this is correct but not complete.» p52

### Elements of the price of production

«The price of production of a commodity is first of all composed of the "cost price" to the employer of the means of production and of the average profit on the capital employed.», p52

### Elements of the cost of price of the means of production

«The cost of price of the means of production consists again of two component parts: the outlay of variable capital, that is, the money immediately paid in wages, and the outlay for consumed or used-up constant capital—raw material, machines, and the like.», p52

### In a capitalist society the cost price of means of production correspond to other prices of production + surplus

«As Marx rightly explains, [...], in a society in which the values have already been changed into prices of production, the purchase or cost price of these means of production does not correspond with their value but with the total amount which has been expended by the producers of these means of production in wages and material appliances, plus the average profit on this expenditure.», p52-53

### The two components of prices of production

«If we continue this analysis we come at last [...] to resolve the price of production into two components or determinants: (1) the sum total of the wages paid during the different stages of production, which taken altogether represent the actual cost price of the commodities; and (2) the sum total of the _profits_ on all these wage outlays calculated _pro rata temporis_, and according to the average rate of profit.», p53

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p195

### Paraphrasing the two components of prices of production

«_one_ determinant of the price of production of a commodity is the average profit incidental to its production. Of the other determinant, the total of wages paid», p53

### How to calculate the total expenditure in wages

«It is evident that the total expenditure in wages is a product of the quantity of labor employed multiplied by the average rate of the wages.», p53

### For Marx rate of wages has no effect in the value of commodities

«Marx repeatedly and most emphatically denies that the rate of wages has any influence on the value of the commodities», p53

> Note: author is referencing Capital, Vol. III, p243

### Only the first determinant of prices of production is in harmony with the law of value

«only the amount of labor employed is in harmony with the law of value, while in the second component, rate of wages, a determinant alien to the law of value enters among the determinants of the pieces of production.», p53-54

### The law of value determines the aggregate value

«the _law of value_ determines the _aggregate value_ of the whole of the commodities produced in the society», p56

### The aggregate value determines the aggregate surplus value

«the _aggregate value_ of the commodities determines the _aggregate surplus value_ contained in them», p56

### The aggregate surplus value determines the average rate of profit

«the latter distributed over the total social capital determines the _average rate of profit_»
, p56

### The law of value regulates the price of production

«In this way the first link in this sequence, the _law of value_, regulates the last link, the _price of production_.», p56

### The surplus that goes in is different from the one that comes out

«he [Marx] says emphatically in numerous places that the amount of surplus value which enters into the price of production of a commodity is independent of and indeed fundamentally different from "the surplus value actually created in the sphere in which the separate commodity is produced"»

> Note: emphasis added by me
> Note: author is quoting from Capital Vol. III, p198 & p195

### Marx links the law of value to the aggregate value of all commodities

«He [Marx] therefore does not after all connect the influence ascribe to the law of value with the characteristic function of the law of value, in virtue of which this law determines the exchange relations of the _separate commodities_, but only with another assumed function [...], namely, the determination of the aggregate value _of all commodities_.», p56

### The law of value doesn't make sense when applied to the aggregate

«If the idea and the law of value are to be brought to bear—and Marx certainly means that they should—on the exchange relations of goods, then there is no sense in applying the idea and law to an aggregate which as such cannot be subject to those relations.», p56-57

### Böhm-Bawerk's rationale

«As no exchange of this aggregate takes place, there is naturally neither a measure nor a determinant for its exchange, and therefore it cannot give material for a "law of value".», p57

### The average value does not represent the total of the surplus value

«That aggregate value, therefore, does not in any case rule the amount of the total surplus value by itself alone. It can at the most supply only _one_ determinant of tis amount, by the side of which stands a second alien determinant, the rate of wages.», p57

### Wages can deviate permanently

«the wages (apart from purely temporary oscillations) may permanently deviate from the rate which should correspond to the quantity of work incorporated in the necessary means of subsistence, or to the strict requirements of the law of value.», p58

### Wages are a determinant of value, contradicting the law of value

«Therefore at least _one_ determinant alien to the law of value is already a factor in determining the total surplus value.», p58

### The amount of existing capital also determines the rate of profit

«The factor, aggregate surplus value, thus determined, "regulates," according to Marx, the average rate of profit, but obviously only in so far as the aggregate surplus value furnishes _one_ determinant, while another—the amount of capital existing in a given society—acts as a second determinant, entirely independent of the first and of the law of value.», p58

### The average rate of profit regulates the average profit

«We must, therefore, further conclude that the average rate of profit regulates the amount of the concrete average profit which accrues from the production of a special commodity.», p59

### Extreme condition for this to occur

«But this, again, is only true with the same restrictions [...]. That is to say, the total amount of the average profit which accrues from the production of a separate commodity is the product of two factors: the quantity of invested capital multiplied by the average rate of profit.», p59

### The quantity of capital invested is partially determined by the average rate of profit which is incompatible with the law of value

«The quantity of the capital to be invested in the different stages is again determined by two factors, namely, by the quantity of the work to be remunerated (a factor which is of course not out of harmony with Marx's law of value), and also by the rate of wages to be paid; and with this latter factor, as we have just convinced ourselves, a factor alien to the law of value comes into play.», p59

### Reformulation of the average profit

«the average profit [...] must regulate the price of production of the commodity. This is true with the correction that the average profit is only _one_ factor determining prices side by side with the expended wages in which, [...], there is an element, which is foreign to Marx's law of of value, and which co-operates in determining prices.», p59

### The proposition Marx was trying to prove

«prices of production are governed "in the last resort" by the principle that quantity of labor is the only condition which determines the exchange relations of commodities.», p59

### The two components of the price of production

«We find that the price of production is, first of all, made up of two components. One, the expended wages, is the product of two factors, of which the first—the quantity of work—is in harmony with the substrance of the Marxian "value," and the other—the rate of wages—is not.», p60

### Marx's unfit solution

«Marx himself could only affirm of the second component—the total amount of accruing average profit—that it was connected with the law of value by means of a violent perversion of this law, alleging its operation in a domain in which no exchange relations exist at all.», p60

### Foreign elements to the law of value bring it down

«The "aggregate surplus value" would have to co-operate with a completely foreign element, the mass of social capital, in determining the average rate of profit; and, finally, the latter would have to co-operate with a partially foreign element, expended wages, in determining the accruing total profit.», p60

### Böhm-Bawerk's conclusion

«The quantity of labor which, according to the Marxian law of value, must entirely and exclusively govern the exchange relations of commodities proves itself as a matter of fact to bhe only _one_ determinant of the prices of production side by side with other determinants. It has a strong, a tolerably direct influence on the one component of prices of production which consist of expended wages; a much more remote, weak, and for the most part, even problematical influence upon the second component, the average profit.», p60-61

### Reality disagrees with the 'law of value'

«facts show that it is _not_ only the quantity of labor, or the factors in harmony with it, which determine the exchange relations.», p61

### Marx is clear about the matter

«This is what Marx does. He declares most emphatically that nothing can be at the root of exchange relations but quantity of labor alone», p62

### The contradiction between the first and the third volume

«From the exclusive position of quantity of labor as the sole determinant of exchange relations he deduces in two volumes the most weighty and practical conclusions [...] in order, in the third volume, to develop a theory of prices of production which substantially recognizes the influence of other determinants as well.», p62

### Marx ignoring phenomena

«He is silent about the co-ordinate influence of foreign determinants as well as about the influence of the amount of social capital on the rate of profit, and about the alteration of prices through a change in the organic composition of the capital, or in the rate of wages.», p62

### Marx ignores these phenomena on purpose to avoid admmiting the contradiction even exists

«It is characteristic that in the passages devoted to the justification of his law of value Marx passes silently over these other influences, and only mentions in a one-sided way the part played by quantity of labor, in order to deduce from the first and undisputed premise, that quantity of labor co-operates at many points to determine the prices of production, the utterly unjustifiable conclusion that, in the "last resort," the law of value, which proclaims the sole dominion of labor, determines the prices of production. This is to evade the admission of the contradiction; it is not to escape from the contradiction itself.», p63

### To be aware of a contradiction is not enough

«To be aware that there is a defect in a system, which may possibly be accidental only and peculiar to the author, requires a comparatively low degree of critical intelligence.», p64

### How to overthrow a system of ideas

«A firmly rooted system can only be effectually overthrown by discovering with absolute precision the point at which the error made its way into the system and the manner in which it spread and branched itself out.», p64

### How Marx reached that conclusion?

«the proposition that all value depends solely upon incorporated quantities of labor?», p65

### Is not self-evident that value and effort are related

«Value and effort [...] are not ideas so intimately connected that one is force immediately to adopt the view that effort is the basis of value.», p65

### Where does exchange value comes from

«The fundamental proposition which Marx puts before his readers is that the exchange value of commodities [...] finds its origin and its measure in the quantity of labor incorporated in the commodities.»

### For Böhm-Bawerk, Marx was aware of the facts contradicting his doctrine

«The reasoning of the third volume proves that he was quite aware of the nature of the empirical facts, and that they were opposed to this proposition.», p66

### For Böhm-Bawerk, Marx was aware of how cost of production influenced prices

«He knew that the prices of commodities were not in proportion to the amount of incorporated labor, but to the total cost of production, which comprises other elements.», p66

### Marx never goes deep into the idea of supply and demand

«"the deeper analysis" of the two social forces, "demand and supply"—which would have led to this internal connection—"is not apposite here", [...] where the "here" refers only to a digression on the influence of supply and demand on the formation of prices. In reality, however, nowhere in the whole Marxian system is a really "deep" and thorough analysis attempted.», p67

### Marx ignoring evidence

«But here again we notice something strange. Marx does not, as might have been expected, pass over this second possible and natural method of investigation with an easy carelessness. He studiously avoids it, and with a full consciousness of what the results of following it would be, and that they would not be favorable to his thesis.», p67

### Marx renames "supply and demand" to "competition"

«In the third volume, [...], he actually brings forward, under their roughly collective name of "competition," those motives operative in production and exchange, [...]», p67-68

### Marx "proves" that "competition" don't determine prices, but something else

«and demonstrates that these motives do not in reality lead to an adjustment of the prices to the quantities of labor incorporated in the commodities, but that, on the contrary, they force them away from this level to a level which implies at least one other co-ordinating factor.», p67-68

### It makes sense logically, but doesn't map out to reality

«Now Marx, instead of proving his thesis from experience or from its operant motives [...] prefers another, [...] the method of a purely logical proof, a dialectic deduction from the very nature of exchange.», p68

### It's Aristotle's fault

«Marx had found in old Aristotle the idea that "exchange cannot exist without equality, and equality cannot exist without commensurability"», p68

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p68

### He expands on Aristotle's idea

«He conceives the exchange of two commodities under the form of an equation, and from this infers that "a common factor of the same amount" must exist in the things exchanged and thereby equated, and then proceeds to search for this common factor to which the two equated things must as exchange values be "reducible"», p68

> Note: Author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p43

### For Böhm-Bawerk, exchange is the result of an inequality, not of equality

«Where equality and exact equilibrium obtain, no change is likely to occur to disturb the balance. When, therefore, in the case of exchange the matter terminates with a change of ownership of commodities, it points rather to the existence of some inequality or preponderance which produces the alteration.», p68

### Consensus between economists

«And as a matter of fact modern political economists agree that the old scholastico-theological theory of "equivalence" in the commodities to be exchanged is untenable.», p69

### How Marx "found" the common factor of exchange

«He passes in review the various properties possessed by the objects made equal in exchange, and according to the method of exclusion separates all those which cannot stand the test, until at last only one property remains, that of being the product of labor.», p69

### Marx utilizes "negative proof"

«Marx tries to convince us that he has found the sought-for property, by a purely negative proof, by showing that it is not any of the other properties.», p69

### Marx cheats.

«From the beginning he only puts into the sieve those exchangeable things which contain the property which he desires finally to sift out as the "common factor," and he leaves all the others outside. He acts as one who urgently desiring to bring a white ball out of an urn takes care to secure this result by putting in white balls only.», p70

### His theory of labor value doesn't apply to natural resources

«Now it stands to reason that if exchange really means an equalization, which assumes the existence of a "common factor of the same amount," this common factor must be sought and found in every species of goods which is brought into exchange, not only in products of labor but also in gifts of nature, such as the soil, wood in trees, water power, coal beds, stone quarries, petroleum reserves, mineral waters, gold mines, etc.», p70

### Marx's method is flawed

«To exclude the exchangeable goods which are not products of labor in the search for the common factor which lies at the root of exchange value is, under the circumstances, a great error of method.», p70

### Natural gifts are common and important commodities

«The exclusion of the gifts of nature [...] is the less to be justified because many natural gifts, such as the soil, are among the most important objects of property and commerce, and also because it is impossible to affirm that in nature's gifts exchange values are always established arbitrarily and by accident.», p71

### Marx doesn't include all exchangeable goods

«Marx also takes care to avoid mentioning or explaining the fact that he excludes from his investigation a part of exchangeable goods. [...] He omits to call his readers' attention to the fact that his idea of "commodities" is narrower than that of exchangeable goods as a whole.», p71

### Marx puts his thumb in the scale to mislead us

«He very cleverly prepares us for the acceptance of the subsequent limitation of the investigation to commodities by placing at the beginning of his book the apparently harmless general phrase that "the wealth of the society in which a capitalist system of production appears as an immense _collection of commodities_», p71

### Why leaving the gifts of nature is wrong

«For the gifts of nature, inclusive of the soil, constitute a by no means insignificant, but on the contrary a very important element of national wealth.», p71-72

### Marx limits the range of commodities without telling us

«On the next page (p. 44), however, Marx directs his search for the "common factor" only to the "exchange value of _commodities_," without hinting, even in the faintest whisper, that he was thereby limited the field of research to a part only of the things possessing exchange value.», p72

### Marx extends his thesis from the particular to the general

«And immediately, on the next page (p. 45), the limitation is again abandoned and the results just obtained in the narrower area are applied to the wider sphere of values in use, or goods. "A _value in use_, or a _good_, has therefore only a value because abstract human labor is stored up or materialized in it."», p72-72

### Marx limited the definition of commodity in order to get the results he wanted

«If Marx had not confined his research at the decisive point, to products of labor, but had sought for the common factor in the exchangeable gifts of nature as well, it would have become obvious that work cannot be the common factor.», p73

### Marx was a smart weasel

«This trick could only have been performed, as Marx performed it, by gliding unnoticed over the knotty point with a light and quick dialectic.», p73

### Firs intentional exclusion of other common factors by Marx

«Marx excludes all "geometrical, physical, chemical, or other natural properties of the commodities," for "their physical properties only come into consideration in so as far as they make the commodities useful—make them values in use, therefore". _On the other hand, the exchange relation of commodities evidently involves our disregarding their values in use"_; because "_within this relation_ [the exchange relation] _one value in use is worth exactly as much as every other, provided only it is present in proper proportions_"», p73-74

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p44

### The problem with Marx's thinking

«They confuse abstraction from the genus, and abstraction from the specific forms in which the genus manifests itself.», p74

### Other common factors in commodities

«"If the use value of commodities be disregarded"—these are Marx's words—"there remains in them _only one other property, that of being products of labor_." Is it so? [...] is there only one other property? Is not the property of being scarce in proportion to demand also common to all exchangeable goods? Or that they are subjects of demand and supply? Or that they are appropriated? Or that they are natural products?», p75

### Marx has not provided positive evidence for his claim

«Why then, [...], may not the principle of value reside in any one of these common properties as well as in the property of being products of labor? For in support of this latter proposition Marx has not adduced a shred of positive evidence.», p75-76

> Note: see "negative thinking"

### Marx's dialectical method is flawed

«If Marx had chanced to reverse the order of the examination, the same reasoning which led to the exclusion of the value in use would have excluded labor; and then the reasoning which resulted in the crowning of labor might have led him to declare the value in use to be the only property left, and therefore to be the sought-for common property, and value to be "the cellular tissue of value in use."», p77

### Marx is too smart for this mistakes

«It would have been impossible for a thinker such as he was [...] to have followed such tortuous and unnatural methods had he been engaged, with a free and open mind, in really investigating the actual connection of things, and in forming his own conclusions with regard to them; it would have been impossible for him to fall successively by mere accident into all the errors of thought and method which I have described, and to arrive at the conclusion that labor is the source of value as the natural outgrowth, not the desired and predetermined result, of such a mode of inquiry.», p77

### Labor value theory is pure opinion

«the grounds of his conviction are not those which he gives in his system. They were in reality opinions rather than thought out conclusions.», p78

### Opinion of authority, nothing more

«Above all they were opinions derived from authority. Smith and Ricardo, the great authorities, as was then at least believed, had taught the same doctrine. They had not _proved_ it any more than Marx.», p78

### Where Smith and Marx agree

«Smith, in the same way as Marx in his third volume, taught that in a developed economic system values and prices gravitate towards a level of costs which besideds labor comprises an average profit of capital.», p78

### Where Ricardo and Marx agree

«And Ricardo, too, in the celebrated fourth section of the chapter "On Value," clearly and definetely stated that by the side of labor, mediate or immediate, the amount of capital invested and the duration of the investment exercise a determining influence on the value of the goods.», p78

### Mental gymnastics

«In order to maintain without obvious contradiction their cherished philosophical principle that labor is the "true" source of value, they were obliged to beat a retreat to mythical times and places in which capitalists and landed proprietors did not exist.», p78

### Impossible circumstances that made the claim unfalseable

«There they could maintain it without contradiction, for there was nothing to restrain them. Experience, which does not support the theory, was not there to refute them. Nor were they restrained by a scientific, psychological analysis, for like Marx they avoided such an analysis.», p78

### Why Marx chose the dialectical method to prove his premise

«It is clear that he could not rely simply on the classical writers for this, as they had not proved anything; and we also know that he could not appeal to experience, or attempt an economico-psychological proof, for these methods would have straightway led him to a conclusion exactly opposite to the one he wished to establish. So he turned to dialectical speculation, which was, moreover, in keeping with the bent of his mind.», p79

### Treating the premise as the conclusion

«He knew the result that he wished to obtain, and must obtain, and so he twisted and manipulated the long-suffering ideas and logical premises with admirable skill and subtlety until they actually yielded the desired result in a seemingly respectable syllogistic form.», p79

### The real life experience vs the theory

«it is obvious even to the casual observer that this proposition cannot maintain itself in the face of certain facts. The day's product of a sculptor, of a cabinet maker, of a violin-maker, of an engineer, etc., certainly does not contain an equal value but a much higher value than the day's product of a common workman or factory hand, although in both the same amount of working time is "embodied."», p80

### It's about "unskilled labor"

«he declares that labor in the sense of his proposition means the "expenditure of simple [unskilled] labor power, an average of which is possessed in his physical organism by every ordinary man, without special cultivation"; or in other words "_simple average labor_"», p80

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p51 y p46

### Skilled labor vs Unskilled labor

«"Skilled labor," he continues, "_counts only as concentrated or rather multiplied unskilled labor_, so that a small quantity of skilled labor is equal to a larger quantity of unskilled labor."», p81

### The proportions are determined by social processes

«"The different proportions in which different kinds of labor are reduced to unskilled labor as their unit of measure are fixed by a social process beyond the control of the producers, and therefore seem given to them by tradition."», p81

### Unskilled labor as the common factor between commodities

«the labor of five days is obviously not "the same amount" as the labor of one day. Therefore Marx, in the case before us, is no longer speaking of labor as such but of unskilled labor. The common factor must therefore be the possession of an equal amount of labor of a particular kind, namely, unskilled labor.», p81-82

### Different kinds of labor

«for in sculpture there is no "unskilled labor" at all embodied, much less therefore unskilled labor equal to the amount in the five days' labor of the stone-breaker. The plain truth is that the two products embody _different kinds_ of labor in _different amounts_»,, p82

### The exchange relations determines the standard of reduction

«Here we stumble against the very natural but for the Marxian theory the very compromising circumstance that the standard of reduction is determined solely _by the actual exchange relations themselves_.», p83

### Böhm-Bawerk's question about the standard of reduction

«in what proportions skilled is to be translated into terms of simple labor in the valuation of their products is not determined, nor can it be determined a priori by any property inherent in the skilled labor itself, but it is the actual result alone which decides the actual exchange relations.», p83

### why different amounts of labor yield different values

«The real subject of inquiry is the exchange relations of commodities: why, for instance, a statuette which has cost a sculptor one day's labor should exchange for a cart of stones which has cost a stone-breaker five day's labor, and not for a larger or smaller quantity of stones, in the breaking of which ten or three days' labor have been expended.», p83

### Marx is arguing in circles

«He [Marx] says the exchange relation is this, and no other—because one day of sculptor's work is reducible exactly to five days of unskilled work. And why is it reducible to exactly five? Because experience shows that it is so reduced by a social process. And why is this a social process? The same process that has to be explained, that very process by means of which the product of one day of sculptor's labor has been made equal to the value of the product of five days of common labor.», p83-84

> Node: emphasis is ours

### The Marxian non-answer: because it is what it is

«Bu if as a matter of fact it were exchanged regularly agains the product of only three days of simple labor, Marx would equally bid us accept the rate of reduction of 1:3 as the one derived from experience, and would found upon it and explain by it the assertion that a statuette must be equal in exchange to the product of exactly three days of a stone-breaker's work—not more and not less.», p84

### Marx doesn't have an answer other than: it is what it is

«In short, it is clear that we shall never learn in this way the actual reasons why products of different kinds of work should be exchanged in this or that proportion. They exchange in this way, Marx tell us, though in slightly different words, because, according to experience, they do exchange in this way!», p84

### Grabski's argument

«"It is not fiction but a fact," says Grabski, "that an hour of skilled labor contains several hours of unskilled labor." For "in order to be consistent, we must also take into account the labor which was used in acquiring the skill."», p84

### Flawed reasoning from Grabski

«With the very same reasoning one could affirm and argue the proposition that the quantity of material contained in commodities constitutes the principle and measure of exchange value—that commodities exchange in proportion to the _quantity of material incorporated in them_.», p85

### Using Grabski and Marx line of reasoning to reach a nonsensical conclusion

«Ten pounds of material in one kind of commodity exchange against ten pounds of material in another kind of commodity. If the natural objection were raised that this statement was obviously false because ten pounds of gold do not exchange against ten pounds of iron but against 40,000 pounds, or against a still greater number of pounds of coal», p85

### Using the same logic as Marx to get out of the trouble

«we may reply after the manner of Marx that it is the amount of _common average material_ that affects the formation of value, that acts as unit of measurement.», p86

### The two flaws in Marxian thinking

«the impartial reader will easily recognize one more in these two arguments the two ingredients of the Marxian recipe—the substitution of "to count" for "to be," and the explanation in a circle which consist in obtaining the standard of reduction from the actually existing social exchange relations which themselves need explanation.», p86

### Marx accept "exceptions" to his law of value

«This hypothetical abstraction he [Marx] combines with a uncommonly clever dialectical move.  He [Marx] gives certain actual deviations from the law, from which a theorist may really venture to abstract, namely, the accidental and temporary fluctuations of the market prices round their normal fixed level.», p87

> note: emphasis is ours

### Dialectical move to pretend the exceptions to his law of value are not important

«And on the occasions when Marx explains his intention to disregard the deviations of the prices from the values he does not fail to direct the reader's attention to those "accidental circumstances" which have to be ignored as "the constant oscillations of the market prices," whose "rise and fall compensate each other," and which "reduce themselves to an average price as their inner law."», p87

### Deviating the eye from the error of method

«By this reference he gains the reader's approval of his abstraction, but the fact that he does not abstract merely from accidental fluctuations but also from regular, permanent, typical "deviations," whose existence constitutes an integral part of the rule to be elucidated, is not closely observant, and he glides unsuspectingly over the author's fatal error of method.», p87

### What the Marxist theory of surplus value tries to explain

«Marx's theory of surplus value aims at nothing else than the explanation, as he conceives it, of the profits of capital.», p87

### The problem with the theory of surplus value

«But the profits of capital lie exactly in those regular deviations of the prices of commodities from the amount of their mere costs in labor. If, therefore, we ignore those deviations, we ignore just the principal part of what has to be explained.», p87

### The dishonest approach of the defenders of the law of value

«"they [the adherents of the exploitation theory] first ignore the exceptions in order to proclaim their law of value as universal. And after thus assuming its universality they again draw attention to the exceptions in order to brand them as offenses agains the law."», p88

> Note: author is quoting "Capital and Interest", p388

### Internal logical consistency, but it breaks when faced with the real world

«By his maneuver of abstraction Marx certainly gained a great tactical advantage for his own version of the case. He, "by hypothesis," shut out from his system the disturbing real world, and did not therefore, so long as he could maintain this exclusion, come into conflict with it; and he does maintain it through the greater part of the first volume, through the whole of the second volume, and through the first quarter of the third volume.», p88

### How Marx plays the game

«Marx is free to use good logic here because, by means of hypothesis, he has in advance made the facts to square with his ideas, and can therefore be true to the latter without knocking up agains the former.», p88

### Why Marx is considered a good intellectual

«However wrong the starting point may be, these middle parts of the system, by their extraordinary logical consistency, permanently establish the reputation of the author as an intellectual force of the first rank.», p88-89

### Marx had to admit at the end that the law of value doesn't hold true

«He had at last to confess to his readers that in actual life commodities do not exchange, regularly and of necessity, in proportion to the working time incorporated in them, but in part exchange above and in part below this proportion, according as the capital invested demands a smaller or a larger amount of the average profit», p89

### The challenges Marx had to face

«In the first place he [Marx] had to justify himself to his readers for having in the earlier parts of his work and for so lon taught that labor was the sole determinant of exchange relations; and secondly—what was perhaps the more difficult task—he had also to give his readers a theorical explanation of the facts which were hostile to his theory, an explanation which certainly could not fit into his labor theory of value without leaving a residuum, but which must not, on the other hand, contradict it.», p89

### How Marx approached the situation

«Marx had to do violence to facts in order to deduce a theorem which could not be straightforwardly deduced from them, and he had to do still greater violence to logic and commit the most incredible fallacies into the bargain.», p89-90

### The two breaking points in the Marxian system

«The first place is just at the beginning when the theory first separates itself from the facts, and the second is after the first quarter of the third volume when facts are again brought within the horizon of the reader.», p90

### Definition of Competition

«"COMPETITION," as I have already hinted, is a sort of collective name for all the psychical motives and impulses which determine the action of the dealers in the market, and which thus influence the fixing of prices.», p91

### Marx doesn't consider "competition" relevant

«Marx is now, for the most part, engaged in the endeavor to give to competition and the forces operating in it the lowest possible place in his system. He either ignores it, or, if he does not do this, he tries to belittle the manner and degree of its influence where and whenever he can.», p91

### The labor value theory ignores completely the role of competition when determining value

«Every impartial person knows and sees that that the influence which the quantity of labor employed exerts on the permanent level of prices of goods [...] acts only through the play of supply and demand, that is to say, through competition.», p91

### How Marx views supply and demand: as irregular market prices

«He [Marx] starts by saying that when one of the two factors preponderates over the other, demand over supply, for instance, or vice versa, irregular market prices are formed which deviate from "market value," which constitutes the "point of equilibrium" for these market prices.», p93

### A hot air balloon under the Marxian perspective

«At a certain height both forces, density of the balloon and density of the surrounding air, are in equipoise. They, therefore, "cease to act," they "cease to explain anything," they do not affect the degree of ascent, and if we wish to explain this we must do it by "something else than the agency of these two forces."», p96

### That is the reasoning behind Marx's idea of supply and demand

«I think the fallacy here is obvious, and that it is not less obvious that the same kind of fallacy lies at the root of the arguments by which Marx reasons away the influence of supply and demand on the level of permanent prices.», p97

### Next challenge for Marx: why prices tend toward prices of production and not quantity of labor

«he [Marx] is confronted by the task of explaining why the permanent prices of commodities do not gravitate toward the incorporated quantity of labor but towards the "prices of production" which deviate from it.»

### Marxian "Solution" to  prices tend toward prices of production and not quantity of labor

«Competition reduces the original rates of profit, which were different fro the different branches of production according to the different organic compositions of the capitals, to a common average rate of profit, and consequently the prices must in the long run gravitate towards the prices of production yielding the one equal average profit.», p97

### Böhm-Bawerk's question on competition

«If, according to Marx, the relation of supply and demand exerts no influence at all on the level of permanent prices, how can competition, which is identical with this relation, be the power which shifts the level of the permanent prices from the level of "value" to a level of so different as the of the price of production?», p98

### What competition tell us about the the labor value theory

«Do we not rather see, in this force and inconsistent appeal to competition as the _deus ex machina_ which drives the permanent prices from that center of gravitation which is in keeping with the theory of embodied labor to another center, an involuntary confession that the social forces which govern actual life contain in themselves, and bring into action, some elementary determinants of exchange relations which _cannot_ be reduced to working time, and that consequently the analysis of the original theory which yielded working time alone as the basis of exchange relations was an incomplete one which di not correspond with the facts?», p98

### The contradiction in the concept of "competition"

«he [Marx], at that time, appealed to competition as a factor which tends to push the prices of commodities towards their "values." And now we learn, on the contrary, that competition is a force which pushes the prices of commodities away from their values and on to their prices of production.», p99

### Marx derived everything from dialectic not facts

«Herein lies, I believe, the alpha and omega of all that is fallacious, contradictory, and vague in the treatment of his subject by Marx. His system is not in close touch with facts. Marx has not deduced from facts the fundamental principles of his system, either by means of a sound empiricism or a solid economic-psychological analysis; he founds it on no firmer ground than a formal dialectic.», p101

### The fatal flaw of Marxian system

«This is the great radical fault of the Marxian system at its birth; from it all the rest necessarily springs.», p101

### Werner Sombart's interpretation

«[The] apology [from Werner Sombart], however, shows one peculiar feature. In order to be able to defend Marx's doctrines he has first to put a new interpretation upon them.», p102

> Note: emfasis es nuestro
> 
### Marxian law of value is not in harmony with reality

«Sombart admits [...] that the Marxian law of value is false if it claims to be in harmony with actual experience.», p102

### Sombart's admision

«The "outlawed value" has only "one place of refuge left—_the thought of the theorical economist_... If we want to sum up the characteristics of Marx's value, we would say, _his value is a fact not of experience but of thought_"», p102

> Note: author is quoting from [[Zur Kritik des Ökonomischen Systems von Karl Marx]] in _Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung, Vol. VII_ (1895), p555

### Me too, bro

«first we must stop for a moment to consider the admission that the Marxian value has no existence in the world of real phenomena. I am somewhat curious to know whether the Marxists will ratify this admission.», p103

### The labor value theory claim to exist in the real world

«If you maintain that the same quantity of labor _exists_ in things made equal in exchange, and that these things _must_ be reducible to equal amounts of labor, you are claiming for these conditions an existence in the real world and not merely in thought.», p104

### Marx claims the law of value to be something a kin to a natural law

«he [Marx] claims that his law of value possesses the character and the potency of a _law of nature_, "it forces its way as the law of gravity does when the house comes down over one's head."», p105

> Note: emphasis is ours
> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p86

### The theory of value labor is dead weight

«For either Marx has maintained his law of value in the literal sense, that it corresponds with reality, and if so we agree with Sombart's view that, maintained in this sense, it is false; or he did not ascribe any real authority to it, and then, in my opinion, it cannot be construed in any sense whatever which would give it the smallest scientific importace. Iti s practically and theoretically a nullity.», p106

### What Sombart mean with fact of thought

«What, then, according to Sombart, does the existence of value as a "fact of thought" mean? It means that the "idea of value is an aid to our thought which we employ in order to make the phenomena of economic life comprehensible."», p106

### Sombart's definition of value is vague and arbitrary

«Sombart's nomenclature, therefore, involves the claim either that that property of things, namely the being a product of labor, which is alone taken into consideration, is the deciding factor for all cases of value in the ordinary scientific sense, and thus represents, for example the phenomena of exchange value; or, without any _arrière pensé_ of this kind, his nomenclature may be a purely arbitrary one; and, unfortunately for nomenclatures of that kind, there is as guide no fixed compulsory law, but only good judgment and a sense of fitness.», p107

### Böhm-Bawerk's problem with abstraction

«My esteemed opponent [Werner Sombart] will certainly admin that we cannot make any abstraction we like to suit any scientific purpose we like. For instance, to start by conceiving the different bodies as "nothing but masses," which is legitimate in certain dynamic problems, would be plainly inadmissible in regard to acoustic or optical problems.», p108

### Logic and thought should not be excluded from contact with reality

«even in science "thoughts" and "logic" cannot wholly depart from facts.», p108

### Labor is not the most important element in commodities

«Labor is certainly _not_ the objectively most important circumstance for many goods, especially as regards exchange relations.», p109

### Examples of commodities that are valued independently of human labor

«We may mention, as instances, trunks of old oak trees, beds of coal, and plots of land», p109

### Other factors impact considerably the exchange relations

«and even if it be admitted that it is so for the greater part of commodities, still the fact must be emphasized that the influence of the other factors, which are determining factors along with labor, is so important that actual exchange relations diverge considerably from the line which would correspond with the embodied labor by itself.», p109

### Conflating labor with exchange relations is a methodological mistake

«if work is not the sole important factor in exchange relations and exchange value, bu only _one_, even though the most powerful, important factor among others—a _primus interpares_, as it were—then, according to what has been already said, it is simply incorrect and inadmissible to base upon labor alone a conception of value which is synonymous with exchange value», p110

### Analogy: physicist doing the same

«it is just as wrong and inadmissible as if a natural philosopher were to base the "active force" on the mass of the bodies alone, and were by abstraction to eliminate velocity from his calculation.», p110

### Sombart claims the law of value only exists in thought, then he says it operates in the real world

«he [Werner Sombart] unexpectedly makes a clever sally into the concrete world when he again maintains that his conception of value is adequate to the objectively most relevant fact, or, in more pretentious words, that "_a technical fact which objectively governs_ the economic of existence of human society has found in its adequate economic expression"»

> Note: author is quoting from "Zur Kritik des Ökonomischen Systems von Karl Marx" in _Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung, Vol. VII (1895)_, p577

### If the labor value theory operates in the world, then it must be in harmony with the facts and abandon the realm of thought

«Either the Marxian value claims to be in harmony with actual facts, in which case it should come out boldly with this assertion and not seek to escape the thorough test of facts by entrenching itself behind the position that it had not meant to affirm any actual fact but only to construct "an aid for our thought"», p111

### If the labor value theory operates in the realm of thought, then it must abandon the idea of operating in the real world

«or else it does seek to protect itself behind this rampart, it does avoid the thorough test of fact, and in that case it ought not to claim by the indirect means of vague assertions a kind of concrete significance which could justify belonging to it only if it had stood the testing by facts which it expressly avoided.», p111

### non-labor-based goods are exchanged with labor-based products

«Sombart sees and knows as well as I do that not only products of labor, but pure products of nature too, are put into quantitative relation in exchange, and are therefore practically commensurable with each other as well as with the products of labor.»

### The common factor has yet to be found

«as has also been admitted, products of labor do _not_ exchange in proportion to the labor embodied in them. Should not that rather be a sign to the unbiased theorist that, in spite of Marx, the true common denominator—the true common factor in exchange—has still to be sought for, and sought for in another direction than that taken by Marx?», p112

### Marx ignores the individual in his methodology

«Marx does not trace out the motives which determine individual subjects as economic agents in their mode of action, but he seeks the objective factors, the "economic conditions," which are _independent_ of the will, and, I may add, often also of the knowledge, of the individual.», p113

### Marx hasn't proved objectively nor subjectively that his theory is right

«He [Marx] has not proved his fundamental proposition that labor alone governs exchange relations either objectively, from the external, tangible, objective world of facts (with which on the contrary this proposition is in opposition), or subjectively, from the motives of the exchanging parties; but he gives it to the world in the form of an abortive dialectic, more arbitrary and untrue to facts than has probably ever before been known in the history of our science.», p115

> Note: emphasis is ours

### Marx cannot escape subjectivism when dealing with exchange relations

«Marx did not hold fast to the "objective" pale. He could not help referring to the motives of the operators as to an active force in his system. He does this pre-eminently by his appeal to "competition".», p116

### We are still stucked with Marxism, so...

«What will be the final judgment of the world? Of that I have no manner of doubt. The Marxian system has a past and a present, but no abiding future.», p117

### Dialectical scientific systems are doomed

«Of all sorts of scientific systems those which, like the Marxian system, are based on a hollow dialectic, are most surely doomed.», p117

### Reality imposes itself

«A clever dialectic may take a temporary impression on the human mind, but cannot make a lasting one. In the long run facts and the secure linking of causes and effects win the day.», p117

### Marx didn't win with facts, but with feelings

«In the very young social sciences it was able to attain influence, great influence, and it will probably only lose it very slowly, and that because it has its most powerful support not in the convinced intellectual of its disciples, but in their hearts, their wishes, and their desires.», p117

### The contradictions were made evident too late

«If the teaching and the definitions of the third volume had been presented to the world simultaneously with the first volume, there would have been few unbiased readers, I think, who would not have felt the logic of the first volume to be somewhat doubtful.», p117

### The contradictions would not have stopped, nor will stop, socialists

«But even when this will have happened socialism will certainly not be overthrown with the Marxian system,—neither practical nor theorical socialism. As there was socialism before Marx, so there will be one after him.», p117

### Böhm-Bawerk "predicted" future attempts to save socialism

«There will try to replace the supports which have become rotten. What purification of fermenting ideas will result from this connection the future will show.», p118

### Marx and Hegel's shared destiny

«Marx, however, will maintain a permanent place in the history of the social sciences for the same reasons and with the same mixture of positive and negative merits as his prototype Hegel.», p118

### Both were mistaken geniuses

«The specific theorical work of each was a most ingeniously conceived structure, built up by a fabulous power combination, of innumerable storeys of thought, held together by marvelous mental grasp, but—a house of cards.», p118

## Notes from "Böhm-Bawerk's criticism of Marx" by Rudolf Hilferding

### Böhm-Bawerk's thought he won the discussion

«He [Böhm-Bawerk] believes he has proved the untenability of economic Marxism, and confidently announces that "the beginning of the end of the labor theory of value" has been inaugurated by the publication of the third volume of _Capital_.», p122

> Note: part of the preface written by Rudolf Hilferding
> Note: emphasis is ours

### Refuting Marxism requires refuting the entire system

«But since the Marxist system has to be dealt with in its entirety, this discussion must be more detailed than that which is requisite to meet the objects of the eclectics, objections based upon misunderstanding and concerned only with individual details.», p122

### BW: The most fragile point of Marxism

«according to Böhm-Bawerk the most vulnerable point in the Marxist theory is to be found in the logical and systematic process of distillation by means of which Marx obtains the sought-for "common factor" in labor.», p123-124

### BW: The common factor must be present in all exchange goods

«this common factor must be sought and found in every species of goods which is brought into exchange, not only in products of labor, but also in gifts of nature, such as the soil, wood in trees, water power, etc.», p124

### BW: The capital sin in Marx's method

«To exclude these exchangeable goods is a gross error of method», p124

### BW: Marx avoid mentioning this important detail

«Marx is like wise careful to avoid mentioning that he excludes from investigation a part of exchangeable goods.», p124

### BW: exchangeable goods are not the same as Marxian commodities

«He omits to call his readers' attention to the fact that his idea of "commodities" is narrower than that of exchangeable goods as a whole.», p124

### BW: Exchangeable goods lead to a different common factor

«if he had sought for the common factor in the "exchangeable" gifts of nature as well, it would have become obvious that labor cannot be the common factor.», p124

### BW: The first Marxian fallacy

«Marx excludes all "geometrical, physical, chemical, or other natural qualities of the commodities," for "their physical qualities claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of the commodities—make them use values.», p125

### BW: The second Marxian fallacy

«the exchange relation of commodities is evidently characterized by the abstraction of their use values," because "within this relation (the exchange relation) one use value is as good as another provided only it be present in the proper proportion."», p125

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p44

### BW: The problem with the second Marxian fallacy

«He [Marx] confuses the disregarding of a genus with the disregarding of the specific forms in which the genus manifests itself.», p125

### BW: Special form of value can be disregarded, but not use of value

«The special forms under which use value may appear may be disregarded, but the use value of the commodity in general must never be disregarded.», p125

### You can disregard a commodity that has no use value for you, or others

«Having ceased for me to be a use value, it matters nothing to me that it has a use value for others, possesses utility for this or that other person.», p126

### We only exchange when a commodity doesn't have a use of value for us

«I do not exchange it until the moment arrives when it has ceased to possess a use value for me.», p126

### It applies also to the production of commodities

«Here the individual produces commodities of but one kind, commodities of which one specimen at most can possess a use value for him, whereas in the mass the commodities have for him such value.», p126

### Use value to others is one of the necessary conditions for exchange

«It is a precondition to the exchangeability of the commodities that they should posses utility for others», p126

> Note: "No use value to me is the other necessary condition for exchange"

### Value use is not a "measure"

«but since for me they are devoid of utility, the use value of my commodities is in no sense a _measure_ even for my individual estimate of value», p126

### Value use is not an "objective measure"

«and still less it is a measure of an objective estimate of value.», p126

### Use value enables exchangeability

«the use value consist of the capacity of these commodities to be exchanged for other commodities», p126

### Wrong Implication: exchange value determines use value

«this would imply that the extent of the "use value" is now determined by the extent of the exchange value», p125

### Use value determines exchange value

«not the extent of the exchange value by the extent of the use value.», p125

### (Marxian) Commodities are produced to be exchanged

«As long as goods are not produced for the purpose of exchange, are not produces as commodities», p126

### (Marxian) goods are exchanged incidentally

«as long, [...], as exchange is no more than an occasional incident wherein superfluities only are exchange, goods confront one another solely as use values.», p125

### Value use and exchange value are distinguished as different when goods are produced with the purpose of exchange in mind

«From that moment the distinction becomes firmly established between the utility of an object for the purposes of consumption, and its utility for the purpose of exchange. Its value use becomes distinguished from its exchange value.», p127

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p100

### Exchange value is the commodification of use value

«for "value" is nothing more than an economic modification of use value.», p127

### Labor is a necessary (but not sufficient) to make something useful

«Labor must be done on most things in order to render them useful.», p129

### A good becomes a commodity when the use value and value become alienated (separated/contrasted)

«A good does not become a commodity merely in virtue of being the product of labor. But only in so far as it is a _commodity_ does a good exhibit the contrasted qualities of use value and value.», p129

### In other word: a good becomes a commodity when it enters an exchange relationship with other goods (exchangeable)

«a good becomes a commodity solely through entering into a relationship with other goods, a relationship which becomes manifest in the act of exchange, and which, quantitatively regarded, appears as the exchange value of the good.», p129

### Being a exchange value is what makes a good a commodity

«The quality of functioning as an exchange value thus determines the commodity character of the good.», p129

### Commodities don't enter the realm of exchange by themselves

«But a commodity cannot of its own initiative enter into relationships with other commodities», p129

### Owners must have relationship with the goods that allows them consider the mere idea of exchange

«the material relationship between commodities is of necessity the expression of a personal relationship between their respective owners.», p129

### Private ownership and division creates atomized individuals

«whereas private ownership and the division of labor reduces society into its atoms», p130

### Exchange of products make use social again

«the exchange of products restore to society its social interconnections.», p130

### What the term commodity hides behind

«it is the expression of social relationships between mutually independent producers in so far as these relationships are effected through the instrumentality of goods.», p130

### A commodity is a product of society

«A commodity, however, can be the expression of social relationships only in so far as it is itself contemplated as a product of society, as a thing on which society has stamped its imprint.», p130
