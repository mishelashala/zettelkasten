## Notes

### Premise of the author

«the Marxian teaching was charge from top to bottom with every kind of contracition both of logic and of fact.», p3

### Confronting a model with reality

«General principles can be very prettily put forward in the "general Sections" of a book, but whether they really possess the convincing power ascribe to them by their author can only be ascertained when in the construction of the system they are brought face to face with all the facts in detail.», p4

### What determines the value of commodities

«Max had taught in his first volume that the whole value of commodities was based on the labor embodied in them», p4

### The "law of value"

«and that by virtue of this "law of value" they must exchange in proportion to the quantity of labor which they contain», p4

### Where does profit comes from

«that, further, the profit or surplus value falling to the capitalist was the fruit of extortion practiced on the worker», p4

### Surplus "doesn't come" from constant capital

«the amount of surplus value was not in proportion to the whole amount of the capital employed by the capitalist», p4

### Surplus "comes" from variable capital

«but only to the amount of the "variable" part—that is, to that part of capital paid in wages», p4

### Constant capital "adds no surplus value"

«while the "constant capital," the capital employed in the purchase of the means of production added no surplus value.», p4

### Claim: profit comes from the total sum of invested capital

«In daily life, however, the profit of capital is in proportion to the _total_ capital invested», p4

### Claim: the amount of work doesn't determine the exchange price

«the commodities do not as a fact exchange in proportion to the amount of work incorporated in them.», p4

### Claim: Marx knew about the contradiction with reality

«"This law" (the law, namely, that surplus value is in proportion only to the variable part of capital), "clearly contradicts all prima facie experience."», p4-5

> Note: they are quoting "Capital, Vol. I", p335

### Marx was gonna come up with a solution to the contradiction in later volumes of the Capital

«But at the same time he declares the contradiction to be only a seeming one, the solution of which requires many missing links, and will be postponed to later volumes of his work.»

### It's about fate man

«His simple promise outweighed all logical refutations.», p5

### Marx left a "solution"

«But the preface of the editor, Friedrich Engels, not only contained the reiterated positive assertion that the solution was given in the manuscript left by Marx.», p5

### Marx's dishonest definition of commodities

«he limits from the beginning to _commodities_, by which, according to him, we are not to understand all economic goods, but only those _products of labor_ which are made for the market.», p9

### Definition of commodity

«A commodity is, on one side, a useful thing, which by its properties satisfies human wants of some kind; and on the other, it forms the material medium of exchange value.», p9

### Definition of Exchange Value

«"Exchange value presents itself in the first instance as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which values in use of one kind are exchanged for values in use of another kind, a relation which constantly changes with time and place."»

> Note: Author is quoting Capital Vol. I

### Implication of Exchange Value

«Exchange value, therefore, appears to be something accidental. And yet there must be in this changing relation something that is stable and unchanging», p10

### What do commodities have in common?

«"[...] there exists a common factor of the same magnitude in two different things, in a quarter of wheat and in cwt. of iron. The two things are therefore equal to a third which is in itself neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, so far as it is an exchange value, must therefore be reducible to that third."», p10

### The common factor "is not a physical property"

«"This common factor," Marx goes on, "cannot be a geometrical, physical, chenmical or other natural property of the commodities.», p10

### Physical properties determine values of use

«Their physical properties come into consideration for the most part only in so far as they make the commodities useful, and so make them values in use.», p10

### Values of use "don't determine" exchange relation

«But, on the other hand, the exchange relation of commodities is obviously determined without reference to their values in use.», p10

### Values in use and exchange values are mutually exclusive

«As values in use commodities are above everything of different qualities; as exchange values they can only be of different quantities, and they can, therefore, contain no atom of value in use.», p10

### Common factor by elimination: being products of labor

«If then we abstract from the value in use of commodities, there remains to them only one common property, that of being products of labor.», p10
