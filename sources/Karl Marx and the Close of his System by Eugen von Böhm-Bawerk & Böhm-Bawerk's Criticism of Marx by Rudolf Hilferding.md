## Notes

### Premise of the author

«the Marxian teaching was charged from top to bottom with every kind of contracition both of logic and of fact.», p3

### Confronting a model with reality

«General principles can be very prettily put forward in the "general Sections" of a book, but whether they really possess the convincing power ascribe to them by their author can only be ascertained when in the construction of the system they are brought face to face with all the facts in detail.», p4

### What determines the value of commodities

«Max had taught in his first volume that the whole value of commodities was based on the labor embodied in them», p4

### The "law of value"

«and that by virtue of this "law of value" they must exchange in proportion to the quantity of labor which they contain», p4

### Where does profit comes from

«that, further, the profit or surplus value falling to the capitalist was the fruit of extortion practiced on the worker», p4

### Surplus "doesn't come" from constant capital

«the amount of surplus value was not in proportion to the whole amount of the capital employed by the capitalist», p4

### Surplus "comes" from variable capital

«but only to the amount of the "variable" part—that is, to that part of capital paid in wages», p4

### Constant capital "adds no surplus value"

«while the "constant capital," the capital employed in the purchase of the means of production added no surplus value.», p4

### Claim: profit comes from the total sum of invested capital

«In daily life, however, the profit of capital is in proportion to the _total_ capital invested», p4

### Claim: the amount of work doesn't determine the exchange price

«the commodities do not as a fact exchange in proportion to the amount of work incorporated in them.», p4

### Claim: Marx knew about the contradiction with reality

«"This law" (the law, namely, that surplus value is in proportion only to the variable part of capital), "clearly contradicts all prima facie experience."», p4-5

> Note: they are quoting "Capital, Vol. I", p335

### Marx was gonna come up with a solution to the contradiction in later volumes of the Capital

«But at the same time he declares the contradiction to be only a seeming one, the solution of which requires many missing links, and will be postponed to later volumes of his work.», p5

### It's about fate man

«His simple promise outweighed all logical refutations.», p5

### Marx left a "solution"

«But the preface of the editor, Friedrich Engels, not only contained the reiterated positive assertion that the solution was given in the manuscript left by Marx.», p5

### Marx's dishonest definition of commodities

«he limits from the beginning to _commodities_, by which, according to him, we are not to understand all economic goods, but only those _products of labor_ which are made for the market.», p9

### Definition of commodity

«A commodity is, on one side, a useful thing, which by its properties satisfies human wants of some kind; and on the other, it forms the material medium of exchange value.», p9

### Definition of Exchange Value

«"Exchange value presents itself in the first instance as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which values in use of one kind are exchanged for values in use of another kind, a relation which constantly changes with time and place."»

> Note: Author is quoting Capital Vol. I

### Implication of Exchange Value

«Exchange value, therefore, appears to be something accidental. And yet there must be in this changing relation something that is stable and unchanging», p10

### What do commodities have in common?

«"[...] there exists a common factor of the same magnitude in two different things, in a quarter of wheat and in cwt. of iron. The two things are therefore equal to a third which is in itself neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, so far as it is an exchange value, must therefore be reducible to that third."», p10

### The common factor "is not a physical property"

«"This common factor," Marx goes on, "cannot be a geometrical, physical, chemical or other natural property of the commodities.», p10

### Physical properties determine values of use

«Their physical properties come into consideration for the most part only in so far as they make the commodities useful, and so make them values in use.», p10

### Values of use "don't determine" exchange relation

«But, on the other hand, the exchange relation of commodities is obviously determined without reference to their values in use.», p10

### Values in use and exchange values are mutually exclusive

«As values in use commodities are above everything of different qualities; as exchange values they can only be of different quantities, and they can, therefore, contain no atom of value in use.», p10

### Common factor by elimination: being products of labor

«If then we abstract from the value in use of commodities, there remains to them only one common property, that of being products of labor.», p10

### First implication of abstracting the value in use: no more physical properties

«For if we abstract from the value in use of a commodity, we at the same time abstract from the material constituents and forms which give it a value in use. It is no longer a table, or a house, or yarn, or any other useful thing. All its physical qualities have disappeared.», p11

### Second implication of abstracting the value in use: no more labor embodied in them

«Nor is it any longer the product of the labor or the carpenter, or the mason, or the spinner, or of any other particular productive industry. With the useful character of the labor products there disappears the useful character of the labors embodied in them, and there vanish also the different concrete forms of these labors.», p11

### Result: abstract human labor

«They are no longer distinguished from each other, but are all reduced to identical human labor—abstract human labor.», p11

### Implication: value "is not the same with" exchange value

«It is in dialectical form not identical with exchange value», p11

### Marxian value: logical distilled form of value

«It is a kind of logical distillation from it.», p11

### Exchange value: manifestation of the value of commodities

«"the exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed"», p11

> Note: they are quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p45

### Value is measured by duration of labor

«As labor is the substance of value so the amount of the value of all goods is measured by the quantity of labor contained in them, which is, in its turn, measured by its duration», p11

### Value is measured by socially necessary labor time

«but not by that particular duration, or working time, which the individual who made the commodity has happened to need, but by the working time that is socially necessary.», p11-12

### Definition of "socially necessary labor time"

«Marx defines this last as the "working time required to produce a value in use under the normal conditions of production, and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society"»

> Note: they are quoting Capital, Vol. I, p46

### Only socially necessary labor determines value

«"It is only the quantity of socially necessary labor, or the working time socially necessary for the production of a value in use, which determines the amount of the value."»

### Single commodity vs class of commodity

«The single commodity is here to be regarded as an average specimen of its class.», p12

### Same labor means same value

«Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labor are embodied, or which can be produced in the same working time, have the same value.», p12

### The "law of value"

«It states, and must state, after what has gone before, that commodities are exchanged in proportion to the socially necessary working time incorporated in them.», p12

### Different expression of the "law of value"

«Other modes of expressing the same law are "commodities exchange according to their values" [...], or that "equivalent exchanges with equivalent"», p12

> Note: they are quoting Capital, Vol. I, p177, p184, p217; Capital Vol. III, p221

### Fluctuations in prices "cancel each other over time"

«these "constant oscillations of market prices . . . compensate and cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average price as their inner law"», p12

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p184n

### The "law of value" imposes itself over time

«"In the long run "the socially necessary working time always asserts itself by main force, like an overruling natural law, in the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations"», p12

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p86

### The "law of value" as an "eternal law"

«Marx declares this law to be the "eternal law of the exchange of commodities", [...], and "the rational element" and "the natural law of equilibrium"», p12-13

> Note: author is quoting from Capital Vol. I, p215; Capital, Vol. III, p221

### The doctrine of surplus values is derived from the theory of value

«On these principles of the theory of value Marx founds the second part of the structure of his teaching, his renowned doctrine of surplus value.», p13

### Doctrine of surplus value: where does profit come from?

«In this part he traces the source of the gain which capitalists obtain from their capital.», p13

### How capitalists operate

«Capitalists lay down a certain sum of money, convert it into commodities, and then—with or without an intermediate process of production—convert these back again into more money.», p13

### Profit "doesn't come" from buying under value or selling over value

«He first declares that the surplus value cannot originate either in the fact that the capitalist, as a buyer, buys commodities regularly under their value, nor in the fact that the capitalist, as a seller, sells them over their value.», p13

### Solution: labor power

«The solution Marx finds in this, that there is one commodity whose value in use possesses that peculiar property of being a source of exchange value. This commodity is the capacity of labor, labor power.», p13-14

### Laborers sell themselves as slaves in the market

«It is offered for sale in the market under the twofold condition that the laborer is personally free, for otherwise it would not be his labor power only that would be for sale, but his whole person as a slave», p14

### Laborers have to sell their labor power because they don't own the means of production

«and that the laborer is destitute of "all the means necessary for the realizing of his labor power"», p14

### Otherwise they would not need the capitalist

«for otherwise he would prefer to produce on his own account and to offer for sale his products rather than his labor power.», p14

### Capitalists obtain surplus value from trading labor power

«It is by trading in this commodity that the capitalist obtains the surplus value»

### How "it works"

«and he does in the following way: the value of the commodity, "labor power," is regulated like any other commodity by the working time necessary for its reproduction», p14

### Only paying what is minimally necessary for the subsistence of the worker

«by the working time which is needed to create so much means of subsistence as is required for the maintenance of the worker.», p14

### Paying the laborer "what his work is worth" would lead to no surplus

«But if he [the capitalist] made him [the laborer] work only so many hours a day as are embodied in the labor power itself, and as must have been paid for in the buying of the same, no surplus value would arise.», p14

> Note: clarification added by me

### Working more hours than the hours they are getting payed

«But this is not the way in which capitalists act. Even if they have bought the labor power for a price which only corresponds to six hour's working time, they yet make the laborer work the whole day for them.», p14

### Capitalists pay less than what they receive back

«And now in the product made during this day there are incorporated more hours of labor than the capitalist was obligated to pay for.», p14

### The difference in hours worked and wages is the "surplus value"

«He has, therefore, a greater value than the wages he has paid, and the difference is "surplus value," which falls to the capitalists.», p14

### Surplus is the result of unpaid working hours

«Surplus value, therefore, according to Marx, is due to the fact that the capitalist makes the laborer work for him a part of the day without paying him for it.», p15

### The "necessary working time" covers the cost of living of the worker

«In the first part—the "necessary working time"—the worker produces the means necessary for his own support, or the value for those means; and for this part of his labor he receives an equivalent in wages.», p16

### The capitalist appropriates the "surplus working time"

«During the second part—the "surplus working time"—he is exploited, he produces "surplus value" without receiving any equivalent for it.», p16

### Conclusion: surplus value comes from unpaid work to the worker

«"All surplus value is in substance the embodiment of unpaid working time"», p16

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p585

### For Marx surplus always comes from "living work"

«new surplus value can only be created by the living work which the capitalist gets the worker to perform.», p16

### For Marx surplus never comes from the "means of production"

«The value of the means of production which are used is maintained, and it reappears in a different form in the value of the product, but adds no surplus value.», p16

### Capital converted to constant capital never produces value

«That part of the capital, therefore, which is converted into the means of production, that is, into raw material, auxiliary material, and implements of labor, does not alter the amount of its value in the process of production"», p16

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p233

### Rate of surplus value

«the proportion in which the surplus value stands to the advanced variable part of capital (in which alone the surplus value "makes good its value") Marx calls the _rate of surplus value_.», p16

### Rate of surplus value as an expression of degree of exploitation

«It is identical with the proportion in which the surplus working time stands to the necessary working time, or the unpaid labor to the paid, and serves Marx, therefore, as an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor.», p16-17

### Rate of surplus value and rate of profit are different

«Totally different from this is the rate of profit.», p17

### How rate of profit is calculated

«The capitalist calculates the surplus value, which he appropriates, not only upon the variable capital but upon the total amount of capital employed.», p17

### Logical conclusion: greater variable capital implies higher rate of profiter

«the greater the variable and the less the constant capital employed [...] the higher will be the rate of profit.», p17
