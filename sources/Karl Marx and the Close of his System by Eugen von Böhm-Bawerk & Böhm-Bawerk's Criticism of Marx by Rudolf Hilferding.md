## Notes

### Premise of the author

«the Marxian teaching was charged from top to bottom with every kind of contracition both of logic and of fact.», p3

### Confronting a model with reality

«General principles can be very prettily put forward in the "general Sections" of a book, but whether they really possess the convincing power ascribe to them by their author can only be ascertained when in the construction of the system they are brought face to face with all the facts in detail.», p4

### What determines the value of commodities

«Max had taught in his first volume that the whole value of commodities was based on the labor embodied in them», p4

### The "law of value"

«and that by virtue of this "law of value" they must exchange in proportion to the quantity of labor which they contain», p4

### Where does profit comes from

«that, further, the profit or surplus value falling to the capitalist was the fruit of extortion practiced on the worker», p4

### Surplus "doesn't come" from constant capital

«the amount of surplus value was not in proportion to the whole amount of the capital employed by the capitalist», p4

### Surplus "comes" from variable capital

«but only to the amount of the "variable" part—that is, to that part of capital paid in wages», p4

### Constant capital "adds no surplus value"

«while the "constant capital," the capital employed in the purchase of the means of production added no surplus value.», p4

### Claim: profit comes from the total sum of invested capital

«In daily life, however, the profit of capital is in proportion to the _total_ capital invested», p4

### Claim: the amount of work doesn't determine the exchange price

«the commodities do not as a fact exchange in proportion to the amount of work incorporated in them.», p4

### Claim: Marx knew about the contradiction with reality

«"This law" (the law, namely, that surplus value is in proportion only to the variable part of capital), "clearly contradicts all prima facie experience."», p4-5

> Note: they are quoting "Capital, Vol. I", p335

### Marx was gonna come up with a solution to the contradiction in later volumes of the Capital

«But at the same time he declares the contradiction to be only a seeming one, the solution of which requires many missing links, and will be postponed to later volumes of his work.», p5

### It's about fate man

«His simple promise outweighed all logical refutations.», p5

### Marx left a "solution"

«But the preface of the editor, Friedrich Engels, not only contained the reiterated positive assertion that the solution was given in the manuscript left by Marx.», p5

### Marx's dishonest definition of commodities

«he limits from the beginning to _commodities_, by which, according to him, we are not to understand all economic goods, but only those _products of labor_ which are made for the market.», p9

### Definition of commodity

«A commodity is, on one side, a useful thing, which by its properties satisfies human wants of some kind; and on the other, it forms the material medium of exchange value.», p9

### Definition of Exchange Value

«"Exchange value presents itself in the first instance as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which values in use of one kind are exchanged for values in use of another kind, a relation which constantly changes with time and place."»

> Note: Author is quoting Capital Vol. I

### Implication of Exchange Value

«Exchange value, therefore, appears to be something accidental. And yet there must be in this changing relation something that is stable and unchanging», p10

### What do commodities have in common?

«"[...] there exists a common factor of the same magnitude in two different things, in a quarter of wheat and in cwt. of iron. The two things are therefore equal to a third which is in itself neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, so far as it is an exchange value, must therefore be reducible to that third."», p10

### The common factor "is not a physical property"

«"This common factor," Marx goes on, "cannot be a geometrical, physical, chemical or other natural property of the commodities.», p10

### Physical properties determine values of use

«Their physical properties come into consideration for the most part only in so far as they make the commodities useful, and so make them values in use.», p10

### Values of use "don't determine" exchange relation

«But, on the other hand, the exchange relation of commodities is obviously determined without reference to their values in use.», p10

### Values in use and exchange values are mutually exclusive

«As values in use commodities are above everything of different qualities; as exchange values they can only be of different quantities, and they can, therefore, contain no atom of value in use.», p10

### Common factor by elimination: being products of labor

«If then we abstract from the value in use of commodities, there remains to them only one common property, that of being products of labor.», p10

### First implication of abstracting the value in use: no more physical properties

«For if we abstract from the value in use of a commodity, we at the same time abstract from the material constituents and forms which give it a value in use. It is no longer a table, or a house, or yarn, or any other useful thing. All its physical qualities have disappeared.», p11

### Second implication of abstracting the value in use: no more labor embodied in them

«Nor is it any longer the product of the labor or the carpenter, or the mason, or the spinner, or of any other particular productive industry. With the useful character of the labor products there disappears the useful character of the labors embodied in them, and there vanish also the different concrete forms of these labors.», p11

### Result: abstract human labor

«They are no longer distinguished from each other, but are all reduced to identical human labor—abstract human labor.», p11

### Implication: value "is not the same with" exchange value

«It is in dialectical form not identical with exchange value», p11

### Marxian value: logical distilled form of value

«It is a kind of logical distillation from it.», p11

### Exchange value: manifestation of the value of commodities

«"the exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed"», p11

> Note: they are quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p45

### Value is measured by duration of labor

«As labor is the substance of value so the amount of the value of all goods is measured by the quantity of labor contained in them, which is, in its turn, measured by its duration», p11

### Value is measured by socially necessary labor time

«but not by that particular duration, or working time, which the individual who made the commodity has happened to need, but by the working time that is socially necessary.», p11-12

### Definition of "socially necessary labor time"

«Marx defines this last as the "working time required to produce a value in use under the normal conditions of production, and with the degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in a given society"»

> Note: they are quoting Capital, Vol. I, p46

### Only socially necessary labor determines value

«"It is only the quantity of socially necessary labor, or the working time socially necessary for the production of a value in use, which determines the amount of the value."»

### Single commodity vs class of commodity

«The single commodity is here to be regarded as an average specimen of its class.», p12

### Same labor means same value

«Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labor are embodied, or which can be produced in the same working time, have the same value.», p12

### The "law of value"

«It states, and must state, after what has gone before, that commodities are exchanged in proportion to the socially necessary working time incorporated in them.», p12

### Different expression of the "law of value"

«Other modes of expressing the same law are "commodities exchange according to their values" [...], or that "equivalent exchanges with equivalent"», p12

> Note: they are quoting Capital, Vol. I, p177, p184, p217; Capital Vol. III, p221

### Fluctuations in prices "cancel each other over time"

«these "constant oscillations of market prices . . . compensate and cancel each other, and reduce themselves to the average price as their inner law"», p12

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p184n

### The "law of value" imposes itself over time

«"In the long run "the socially necessary working time always asserts itself by main force, like an overruling natural law, in the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations"», p12

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p86

### The "law of value" as an "eternal law"

«Marx declares this law to be the "eternal law of the exchange of commodities", [...], and "the rational element" and "the natural law of equilibrium"», p12-13

> Note: author is quoting from Capital Vol. I, p215; Capital, Vol. III, p221

### The doctrine of surplus values is derived from the theory of value

«On these principles of the theory of value Marx founds the second part of the structure of his teaching, his renowned doctrine of surplus value.», p13

### Doctrine of surplus value: where does profit come from?

«In this part he traces the source of the gain which capitalists obtain from their capital.», p13

### How capitalists operate

«Capitalists lay down a certain sum of money, convert it into commodities, and then—with or without an intermediate process of production—convert these back again into more money.», p13

### Profit "doesn't come" from buying under value or selling over value

«He first declares that the surplus value cannot originate either in the fact that the capitalist, as a buyer, buys commodities regularly under their value, nor in the fact that the capitalist, as a seller, sells them over their value.», p13

### Solution: labor power

«The solution Marx finds in this, that there is one commodity whose value in use possesses that peculiar property of being a source of exchange value. This commodity is the capacity of labor, labor power.», p13-14

### Laborers sell themselves as slaves in the market

«It is offered for sale in the market under the twofold condition that the laborer is personally free, for otherwise it would not be his labor power only that would be for sale, but his whole person as a slave», p14

### Laborers have to sell their labor power because they don't own the means of production

«and that the laborer is destitute of "all the means necessary for the realizing of his labor power"», p14

### Otherwise they would not need the capitalist

«for otherwise he would prefer to produce on his own account and to offer for sale his products rather than his labor power.», p14

### Capitalists obtain surplus value from trading labor power

«It is by trading in this commodity that the capitalist obtains the surplus value»

### How "it works"

«and he does in the following way: the value of the commodity, "labor power," is regulated like any other commodity by the working time necessary for its reproduction», p14

### Only paying what is minimally necessary for the subsistence of the worker

«by the working time which is needed to create so much means of subsistence as is required for the maintenance of the worker.», p14

### Paying the laborer "what his work is worth" would lead to no surplus

«But if he [the capitalist] made him [the laborer] work only so many hours a day as are embodied in the labor power itself, and as must have been paid for in the buying of the same, no surplus value would arise.», p14

> Note: clarification added by me

### Working more hours than the hours they are getting payed

«But this is not the way in which capitalists act. Even if they have bought the labor power for a price which only corresponds to six hour's working time, they yet make the laborer work the whole day for them.», p14

### Capitalists pay less than what they receive back

«And now in the product made during this day there are incorporated more hours of labor than the capitalist was obligated to pay for.», p14

### The difference in hours worked and wages is the "surplus value"

«He has, therefore, a greater value than the wages he has paid, and the difference is "surplus value," which falls to the capitalists.», p14

### Surplus is the result of unpaid working hours

«Surplus value, therefore, according to Marx, is due to the fact that the capitalist makes the laborer work for him a part of the day without paying him for it.», p15

### The "necessary working time" covers the cost of living of the worker

«In the first part—the "necessary working time"—the worker produces the means necessary for his own support, or the value for those means; and for this part of his labor he receives an equivalent in wages.», p16

### The capitalist appropriates the "surplus working time"

«During the second part—the "surplus working time"—he is exploited, he produces "surplus value" without receiving any equivalent for it.», p16

### Conclusion: surplus value comes from unpaid work to the worker

«"All surplus value is in substance the embodiment of unpaid working time"», p16

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p585

### For Marx surplus always comes from "living work"

«new surplus value can only be created by the living work which the capitalist gets the worker to perform.», p16

### For Marx surplus never comes from the "means of production"

«The value of the means of production which are used is maintained, and it reappears in a different form in the value of the product, but adds no surplus value.», p16

### Capital converted to constant capital never produces value

«That part of the capital, therefore, which is converted into the means of production, that is, into raw material, auxiliary material, and implements of labor, does not alter the amount of its value in the process of production"», p16

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p233

### Rate of surplus value

«the proportion in which the surplus value stands to the advanced variable part of capital (in which alone the surplus value "makes good its value") Marx calls the _rate of surplus value_.», p16

### Rate of surplus value as an expression of degree of exploitation

«It is identical with the proportion in which the surplus working time stands to the necessary working time, or the unpaid labor to the paid, and serves Marx, therefore, as an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor.», p16-17

### Rate of surplus value and rate of profit are different

«Totally different from this is the rate of profit.», p17

### How rate of profit is calculated

«The capitalist calculates the surplus value, which he appropriates, not only upon the variable capital but upon the total amount of capital employed.», p17

### Logical conclusion: greater variable capital implies higher rate of profiter

«the greater the variable and the less the constant capital employed [...] the higher will be the rate of profit.», p17

### Marxian Claim about the organic composition of capital

«The "organic composition" [...] of the capital is for technical reasons necessarily different in the different "spheres of production."», p19

### Pre-supposition: equal rate of surplus value equals different rates of profits

«According to the preceding argument [...] given an equal rate of surplus value, every branch of production must show a different, a special rate of profit, on the condition certainly, which Marx has hitherto always assumed, that commodities exchange with each other "according to their values," or in proportion to the work embodied in them.», p19-20

### Marxian pre-supposition

«His theory demands that capitals of equal amount, but of dissimilar organic composition, should exhibit different profits.», p20

### The real world "shows the contrary"

«The real world, however, most plainly shows that it is governed by the law that capitals of equal amount, without regard to possible differences of organic composition, yield equal profits.», p20

### General tendency of capital

«there is a law (or general tendency), _although only for capitals possessing the same organic composition_—the same periods of turnover being assumed—that the profits are in proportion to the amounts of the capitals, and therefore equal amounts of capital yield in equal periods of time equal amounts of profit.», p20

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### The argument rests on the "law of value"

«The argument rests on the basis which has hitherto generally been the basis of our reasoning, _that commodities are sold according to their values_.», p20

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### The average rate does not exist

«the difference in the average rate of profit for different branches of industry _does not exist_ and could not exist without upsetting the whole system of capitalist production.», p20

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### Marxian claim: The law of value is incompatible with reality

«_It appears therefore that here the theory of values is irreconcilable with the actual movement of things_, irreconcilable with the actual phenomena of production, and that, on this account, the attempt to understand the latter must be given up.»

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p181

### Marx has to get rid of the "law of value"

«To speak plainly his solution is obtained at the cost of the assumption from which Marx has hitherto started, _that commodities exchange according to their values_. This assumption Marx now simply drops.», p21

### Marx solution to different rates of surplus with different organic composition: competition

«Marx goes on to say that all this is not a mere hypothetical assumption, but absolute fact. The operating agent is _competition_.», p23

### Conclusion: composition is originally different

«It is true that owing to the different organic composition of the capitals invested in various branches of production "the rates of profit which obtain in these different branches _are originally very different_"», p23

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### Premise: competition brings down the rates of profit

«But "these different rates of profit are reduced by competition to a common rate which is the average of all these different rates"», p23

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### Average Profit

«The profit corresponding to this common rate, which falls to a given amount of capital, whatever its organic composition may be, is called _average profit._», p23-24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### Price of Production

«That price of a commodity which is equal to its cost price plus its share of the yearly average profit of the capital employed (not merely that consumed) in its production (regard being had to the quickness or slowness of turnover) is its _price of production_», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p186

### Exchange relation is determined by the price of production

«And the actual exchange relation of the separate commodities is _no longer determined by their values but by their prices of production_», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p231

### Value and price of production coincide accidentally

«Value and price of production are only exceptionally and accidentally coincident, namely, in those commodities which are produced by the aid of a capital, the organic composition of which chances to coincide exactly with the _average_ composition of the whole social capital.», p24

### Capitals of Higher Composition

«According to Marx we call "capitals which contain greater percentage of constant, and therefore a smaller percentage of variable capital than the social average capital, capitals of _higher_ composition"», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p193

### Capitals of Lower Composition

«"and contrariwise those capitals in which the constant capital fills a relatively smaller, and the variable a relatively larger space than in the social average capital are called capitals of _lower_ composition"», p24

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p193

### Higher composition leads to above value commodities

«in all those commodities which have been created by the aid of capital of "higher" composition than the average composition the price of production will be _above_ their value», p24

### Lower composition leads to under value commodities

«and in the opposite case it will be _under_ the value.», p24

### Average Profit formula

«the average profit is nothing else "than the total amount of surplus value divided among the amounts of capital in every sphere of production in proportion to their quantities"», p25

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p205

### The question of the adjustment to a common rate of profits

«Marx, in conclusion, puts and answers one more question, which he regards as the specially difficult question: in what manner "does this adjustment of profits to a common rate of profit take place, since it is evidently a result and not a starting point?», p25

### Answer: In pre-capitalists societies that "doesn't happen"

«He first of all puts forward the view that in a condition of society in which the capitalist system is not yet dominant, and in which, therefore, the laborers themselves are in possession of the necessary means of production, commodities are actually exchanged according to their real value, and the rates of profit could _not_ therefore be equalized.», p25-26

### Marx treats it as a "historical fact"

«Marx thinks he is entitled to assert that it is "quite in accordance with facts to regard the values of commodities as, not only theoretically but also historically, prior to the prices of production"», p26

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p209

### The adjustment of rates do take place in capitalist societies

«In societies organized on the capitalist system, however, this changing of values into prices of production and the equalization of the rates of profit which follows certainly do take place.», p26

### Marxian explanation of the adjustments of rates

«"If commodities are . . . sold according to their values . . . very different rates of profit are obtained. . . . Capital withdraws itself, however, from a sphere with a low rate of profit, and throws itself into another which yields a higher profit. By this continual interchange, or, in a word, by its apportionment between the different spheres, as the rate of profit sinks here and rises there, such a relation of supply to demand is created as to make the average profit in the different spheres of production th same, and thus values are changed into prices of production"», p26-27

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol III, p230

### Eugene vom Böm-Bawerk's critic

«"Either products do actually exchange in the long run in proportion to the labor attaching to them—in which case an equalization of the gains of capital is impossible; or there is an equalization of the gains of capital—in which case it is impossible that products should continue to exchange in proportion to the labor attaching them"», p28

> Note: quoting from "Capital and Interest", p362

### Marx responses to the critique

«And he even goes so far as to say, with the same directness and clearness, that the several commodities do not actually exchange with each other in proportion to the labor they contain, but that they exchange in that varying proportion to the labor which is rendered necessary by the equalization of the gains of capital.», p29

### Eugene von Böm-Bawerk's questioning of the response

«does it not prove that the equal average rate of profit can only manifest itself if, and because, the alleged law of value does not hold good?», p29

### Reiterating the Labor Value Theory

«In the first volume it was maintained, with great emphasis, that all value is based on labor and labor alone, and that values of commodities were in proportion to the working time necessary for their production.», p29

### Reiterating labor as the common exchange factor

«The value was declared to be "the common factor which appears in the exchange relation of commodities"», p29

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. I, p45

### Rare exceptions in the "law of value"

«Apart, therefore, from temporary and occasional variations which "appear to be a breach of the law of the exchange of commodities" [...], commodities which embody the same amount of labor _must_ on principle, in the long run, exchange for each other.», p30

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. I, p177

### Contradiction in the volume 3 of the Capital

«And now in the third volume we are told briefly and dryly that what, according to the teaching of the first volume, _must_ be, is not and never can be; that individual commodities do and must exchange with each other in a proportion different from that of the labor incorporated in them, and this not accidentally and temporarily, but out necessity and permanently.», p30

### Marx's defense of the contradiction

«Marx does not omit to interpolate in numerous places the express declaration that, in spite of exchange relations being directly governed by prices of production, which differ from the values, all is nevertheless moving within the lines of the law of value and this law, "in the last resort" at least, governs prices.», p31

### Marx's first argument for his defense

«event if the _separate_ commodities are being sold above or below their values, these reciprocal fluctuations cancel each other, and in the community itself—taking into account all the branches of production—the _total of the prices of production_ of the commodities produced still remains _equal to the sum of their values_», p32

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p188

### Marx's second argument of his defense

«the law of value governs the _movement of prices_, since the diminution or increase of the requisite working time makes the prices of production rise or fall»

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p208, p211

### Marx's third argument of his defense

«the law of value, Marx affirms, governs with undiminished authority the exchange of commodities in _certain "primary" stages_, in which the change of values into prices of production has not yet been accomplished.», p32

### Marx's fourth argument of his defense

«in a complicated economic system the law of value regulates prices of production at least _indirectly and in the last resort_, since the total value of the commodities, determined by the law of value, determines the total surplus value. The latter, however, regulates the amount of the average profit, and therefore the general rate of profit.», p32

> Note: author is paraphrasing from Capital, Vol. III, p212

### The composition of the capital affects exchange relation

«It is admitted by Marx that separate commodities exchange with each other either over or under their value accordingly as the share of constant capital employed in their production is above or below average.», p32-33

### Deviations "cancel each other"

«"In the same proportion in which one part of the commodities is sold above its value another part will be sold under its value"», p33

> Note: author is quoting Capital, Vol. III, p185

### Marx's argument

«Meanwhile it resolves itself into this—that by as much as there is too much surplus value in one commodity there is too little in another, and therefore the _deviations from value_ which lurk in the prices of production _reciprocally cancel each other_ In capitalist production as a whole _'the general law maintains itself as the governing tendency,'_ only in a very complex and approximate manner, as the constantly changing average of perpetual fluctuations.»

> Note: author is quoting from Capital, Vol. III, p190

### Schmidt also arrived at the same conclusion thru a different method

«Schmidt also, while he employed a different line of argument from Marx, arrived at the same conclusion that separate commodities _cannot_ exchange with each other in proportion to the labor attaching to them.», p33-34

### Schmidt also questioned the validity of the law of value

«He too was obligated to ask the question whether, in face of this fact, the validity of Marx's law of value could any longer be maintained, and he supported his affirmative opinion on the very argument that has just been given.», p34

### Schmidt's solution

«Every commodity which comes into exchange is at one and the same time a commodity and the price of what is given in exchange for it. The aggregate of commodities therefore is identical with the aggregate of the prices paid for them; or, the price of the whole national produce is nothing else than the national produce itself.», p35

> Note: author is quoting Conrad Schmidt

### Schmidt's own admission of saying "nothing"

«"[...] this tautological declaration denotes no increase of true knowledge, neither does it serve as a special test of the correctness of the alleged law that commodities exchange in proportion to the labor embodied in them."», p35

> Note: author is quoting Conrad Schmidt
