## I. Primary Texts (Greek + Modern Translations)

|Work|Recommended Edition|Why This One|
|---|---|---|
|**Plato – _Timaeus_**|_Hackett Edition_, trans. Donald J. Zeyl|Most philologically accurate English translation. Zeyl avoids Christianized terms (“God,” “Creation”) and keeps “Demiurge” as _demiourgos_. Excellent intro + glossary.|
|**Plato – _Republic_**|_Cambridge Texts_, trans. G. R. F. Ferrari / Tom Griffith|Clear, modern, and philosophically neutral. Avoids moral-theological overtones of Jowett or Shorey.|
|**Plato – _Phaedo_**|_Oxford World’s Classics_, trans. G. M. A. Grube (rev. Cooper)|Keeps the metaphysical tone without importing Christian immortality concepts.|
|**Plato – _Timaeus_ (Greek Text)**|_Loeb Classical Library_, vol. 234, ed. R. G. Bury|Greek on left, English on right. Bury occasionally slips “God,” but the Greek text is clean and excellent for parallel reading.|
|**Aristotle – _Metaphysics_ (for contrast)**|_Loeb_ or _Penguin Classics_, trans. W. D. Ross or Hugh Lawson-Tancred|Shows how Aristotle dismantles Plato’s metaphysics of the Demiurge and Forms.|

## II. Philological and Philosophical Commentaries on Plato

|Author / Work|Focus|
|---|---|
|**Francis Macdonald Cornford – _Plato’s Cosmology: The Timaeus of Plato_**|The definitive early 20th-century commentary. Classical, rigorous, and pre-theological. Cornford reads Plato as a metaphysician of order, not a theologian.|
|**Luc Brisson – _Plato the Myth Maker_**|Brilliant short book on how Plato uses myth as a philosophical language. Brisson is meticulous about the Greek lexicon (esp. _demiourgos_ and _theos_).|
|**David Sedley – _Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity_**|A must-read. Sedley analyzes how the concept of _creation_ evolved from Plato’s _Timaeus_ to later interpreters. Shows exactly how Christian translators distorted Plato.|
|**Sarah Broadie – _Nature and Divinity in Plato’s Timaeus_**|Dense but extraordinary. Explores how “the divine” in Plato is an ordering principle, not a personified god. Very clear distinctions between Greek metaphysics and later theology.|
|**Thomas Johansen – _Plato’s Natural Philosophy: A Study of the Timaeus and Critias_**|Deep dive into Plato’s cosmology, the soul of the world, and how the Demiurge operates. Excellent for bridging philosophy and philology.|

## III. Historical and Interpretive Context (De-Christianizing the Tradition)

|Author / Work|Focus|
|---|---|
|**Pierre Hadot – _What Is Ancient Philosophy?_**|Shows how philosophy was originally a _way of life_, not a set of doctrines. Explains how later Christianity moralized and theologized ancient concepts.|
|**Werner Jaeger – _Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture_** (Vol. 1 esp.)|A sweeping account of Greek intellectual formation before Christianity. Essential for understanding the Platonic cosmos in its native context.|
|**Lloyd P. Gerson – _Aristotle and Other Platonists_**|Gerson reconstructs the Platonic lineage before Neoplatonism. Helps you see Plato without Christian filters but still within Greek rational metaphysics.|
|**John Dillon – _The Middle Platonists_**|Bridges Plato to Neoplatonism. Shows how _the One_, _the Demiurge_, and _the Forms_ evolved — and when theology began creeping in.|
|**A. H. Armstrong (ed.) – _The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy_**|The best overview of how late antiquity reinterpreted Plato. Great for pinpointing where “Christian Plato” emerges.|

## IV. Optional but Illuminating

|Author / Work|Why It’s Worth Reading|
|---|---|
|**Plotinus – _The Enneads_** (Loeb or Penguin)|The origin of Neoplatonism. Reading him shows _how_ Plato became mystical — you’ll see the precise moment when “the One” becomes a quasi-divine principle.|
|**Proclus – _Commentary on the Timaeus_**|Hard but fascinating. This is the bridge between Greek philosophy and medieval theology.|
|**E. R. Dodds – _The Greeks and the Irrational_**|Contextualizes why rational and mystical currents coexisted in Greek thought — helps explain why Christian thinkers found Plato adaptable.|

## Reading Path

1. **Start**: Plato’s _Timaeus_ (Zeyl) → read alongside Cornford.
2. **Then**: Sedley → Broadie → Johansen (for deeper understanding).
3. **Next**: Hadot → Jaeger (for historical-philosophical context).
4. **Finally**: Dillon → Gerson → Armstrong (to trace the transformation into Neoplatonism/Christianity).
5. **Optionally**: Read Plotinus afterward to _see the distortion happen_.
